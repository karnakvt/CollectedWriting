# The Devil's Skull

The sun beat down on the streets of Gylden. Thick heat rising from the cobbled street, reflecting up a sunny summer's haze. Clara thanked her foresight for packing her parasol that day as her blue gaze swung from left to right. In her nose was the smell of freshly baked cinnamon scrolls and puffed Dwarfen pasties. She twirled her parasol, momentarily distracted by the fronds at the end when a jingle of gold took her attention.

Marcus' face appeared in her vision, and in his outstretched hand was a leather purse, fat with gold. "You dropped this," the cheeky, handsome smile of the boy filling his expression. 

"Marcus !--" Clara cut herself off in shock as she snatched her purse out of his hand, and reattached it to her waistband. Quietly, she mumbled, "You took it from me."

Marcus brought his arms to a fold over his chest, standing up naturally straight from the townsguard training. He looked quite snappy in the gray uniform, which he often wore off-duty as it was one of his better kept pair of clothes. "I did." He admitted simply, "You have to be more careful, every time I see you I just want to rob you, you walk around so exposed."

"You're the only one who ever *does* rob me, though," Clara's felt her cheeks puff out as her lips pursed.

Marcus thumbed his chest, "Because I'll kick the snot out of anyone else who tries, that's why." Clara ended up laughing at his expression, and beckoned him to join her. 

Spending the afternoon together, they walked side by side down the busy streets. Clara stopped frequently to greet people with her usual smile. They went to the armourer, the blacksmith and the leatherworker. Marcus inspected every length of steel he could, and tested every dagger he could get his hands on. They bought pasties at the baker from his famous "Three O'Clock batch", and explored the lengths of the barrows, seeing trinkets and rugs and junk merchants alike. Eventually, Clara guided their shopping trip towards a strange destination. Down an alleyway marked as "Goldblood 35 1/3rd Avenue" the houses rose up on either side of them. At the end of the avenue, a bright yellow door appeared with a blue handle, and a purple sign that gaudily read, "Mr. Marvelous' Wonderous Emporium of Magical Things".

Despite the surroundings, they were greeted inside with a mysteriously cooled atmosphere. Clara felt her dress lift slightly as a cool breeze brushed along the entirety of her skin. "Whooo!" She shivered as she collaped her parasol, "That cold Icewind Air really hits the right spot." She could almost feel her skin being massaged by icecubes as she swished her clothing to greedily lap up more gusts of magically cooled air.

"It makes me uncomfortable," Marcus said shortly, "I prefer the heat myself, it just doesn't feel like Summer when I come into these ritsy shops..."

Clara giggled, finding her hand reaching up and brushing at his lapel, "Oh it's alright, we'll be in and out of here shortly, I know just what I want."

Marcus cocked an eyebrow, "Well that'll be a change, I thought we were going to be here for the next hour or so..."

Clara shook her head, "Oh gods no.. the uhh..."

"Well HellooOOOoooOOooo there," a rotund male appeared at their left. He was as round as he was short, and despite the artificially cooled air, mops of sweat seemed to pour from his brow, that he dabbed gingerly with a many folded handkerchief. "Hello dear children, and welcome to Mr. Marvelous' Wonderous Emporium of Magical Things. I'm Merrick Marvelous, and ahh... Ms. Steibelt it is SO GOOD to see you, how can I help you hmm? Are you here perhaps for a trade? Perhaps I can fetch young Martin for your company?"

Clara was adept at hiding her expression when the situation called for it, but Marcus could easily see her ever-so subtle but still visible cringe when she heard the shopkeeper's voice. Quickly, she responded, "It is always a pleasure, Mr. Marvelous," with a smile that could melt ice. "Unfortunately I wasn't looking for Martin today, but I'm ever so eager to have you over for tea in a week's time."

"Of course, of course! He is quite handsome, my little Martin. A good looker and from good, solid stock! It is good if such well bred children are good friends, don't you think? Also he has Marvelous in the name! Just like his old father."

Clara laughed, pushing her hand over her mouth to hide the way her teeth were gritting. "I was wondering, Mr. Marvelous, I heard that you'd recently gotten a shipment of new trinkets, and I was looking for something pretty for my nightstand..."

Like sweaty thunder, his hands came together in a clap and he moved forward to take her by the shoulder, roughly pulling her from Marcus' side, "Of course, of course. Right this way my dear, I haven't put the good stuff on the shelves yet. Oh, and you can bring your erm... guard if you like too." 

Marcus tried to exchange a look with Clara, imagining her expression at the moment, a combination of 'Get me out of here,' and 'Help me,' saying under his breath as he followed along, "Just what the bloody hell are you wanting here, Clara?"

With that, they were taken into the back room of Mr. Marvelous' emporium. Unlike the showroom, boxes were stacked to the ceiling as the various trinkets, doodads and thingamabobs were piled high. The obsequious salesman gushed endlessly over the young Clara as she delicately brushed her hand over the various gems and jewels, politely shaking her head as she went from one gaudy bauble or piece of jewellery to another. Marcus, for his part, was largely ignored by the shopkeeper, and was free to cast his gaze around the backroom. Eventually eyeing a theatre mask that was twisted in a visage of horror. Turning it over it was stamped, 'Made in Ginda', cheap junk. He put the mask back when he heard a soft "Oh!" from Clara, as her eyes eventually landed on a small, simple-looking wooden stick that was leaning against the counter.

"Oh, what's this?" She reached out to touch it, but her hand was swatted away by the shopkeeper.

"Oh now, now, now, that is not an object for children to be playing with, young Ms. Steibelt." He quickly reached over and snatched the wooden rod from the floor and attemped to hide it from sight. "Such a--uhh, boring looking thing as this has no place in a refined lady's possession."

Clara withdrew her hand, "Oh, but it looked interesting to me, so I thought perhaps I could see it closer..?"

Mr Marvelous' jowels warbled as he shook his head from side to side, "Absolutely not, Ms. Steibelt, this uhh... boring old artefact is really just a small staff for apprentice mages, it really has no uhh..."

"Let her look." Marcus stepped forward. Dressed in his guard's uniform, and towering over the portly little Mr. Marvelous, Marcus' furrowed brow and stern expression gave the sputtering merchant a pause. Of course, Marcus had no ability to threaten, arrest or hold account a shopkeeper who wouldn't show his wares, but thankfully either Mr. Marvelous didn't seem to know that, or he was driven by decorum to present it.

Sheepishly, the rotund man held out the simple-looking rod in his hand, twisting his head away, "Well I do suppose if it is for lady Steibelt I could let her see that it is just a simple stick of wood. Quite boring really."

As she took it from the man's hand, the energy inside the rod instantaneously pulsed inside her chest, causing her to gasp. Eldritch, ancient energy surged through her, it was as if the rod itself were completing a ley-line inside her palm, connecting the magical circuitry of her skull. It was the same sensation as holding an eldritch blast in her palms, and flipping it between her fingers. A crackling, sensational magic energy.

"Oh what a marvelous little thing," Clara cleared her throat, trying to hide a girlish grin as she felt the power in her fingertips. "I think this is just what I was looking for, in fact."

"Oh but no that's a Rod of the Pact--" Mr. Marvelous sputtered, before cutting himself off. "I'm afraid Ms. Steibelt I simply can't sell that to you." He huffed firmly.

Marcus scowled, his hand naturally resting on the hilt of his shortsword. "What do you mean?"

The shopkeep's eyes widened to saucers as he looked up at Marcus, "Well it's meant for-- I simply can't have-- Rrrphm!" he warbled as he sighed in exhasperation. Clara looked at him expectantly, holding the rod to her chest. "Young lady, young sir, I must come clean to you," he sighed. "I do tend to not speak of such things, but what you have there in your hands is actually a rod intended to bolster a warlock's pact abilities..."

"A warlock?!" Clara whispering voice gasped in surprise, and looked down at the rod. Marcus blinked, looking over to Clara and seeing her genuine, shocked expression. Even he was about to momentarily remind her that she was a warlock herself, but caught himself in a smile instead. He marvelled quietly at her seamless abilities to hide what she knew. "Whyever would you have such a dastardly thing, Mr Marvelous?"

The shopkeeper's face went pallid as his cheeks fell. "Ohh you caught me, Ms. Steibelt and I'm so ashamed. An opportunity came to me a month or so ago. A mysterious figure cloaked in a robe black as night came to this very shop and requested I procure such an object, and he was ready to pay quite the price. Gold is gold and I cannot fill my belly on well-wishes alone. You understand, yes?"

"But fiendish magic is evil," Clara insisted, subconsciously gripping the rod in her fingers. Even now, it beckoned to her.

The shopkeeper's jowels warbled as he shook from side to side, "Absolutely Miss Steibelt, but warlocks are not necessarily fiendish! Have you heard, perhaps, of the whimsical songs of Queen Titania? Solemn liege of the fey, and patron to the glamorous knights?"

Clara tilted her head to the side, "I have... but only in passing..."

The shopkeeper snatched the rod from her hands as he stroked it, "Well, this rod is attuned for such warlocks. It strengthens the bonds of the warlock to the feywild, allowing them to cast more spells, and making their magics more deceptive and enthralling!"

Clara balled her fists and stepped forward, "Oh it sounds simply marvelous! I simply must have this rod, Mr. Marvelous! It looks so simple but it's so powerful. And it suits my decorations perfectly."

The shopkeeper shook his head again, "Regretfully, I absolutely cannot sell this to you, Lady Steibelt, your governess would have my head."

Clara's chest deflated slightly, "Surely you're not going to let Ms. Hardgreaves get in the way of your business?"

Merrick stuttered, "I-I've already sold it!"

"I'll outbid him." Clara stepped forward again, until she was almost standing on his toes.

The shopkeeper pulled to the side andstumbled backwards, "No! It would be outrageous for you to own such an item."

"I'll have you over for tea tomorrow and have my family cancel the Feldricks' appointment."

Mr. Marvelous paused, gripping the rod in his mitts and twisting the wood slightly. "The Steibelts will have us for tea?"

Clara smiled, "I'm eager to meet young Martin, after all this time."

"You would make such a fetching couple," he murmered.

Clara felt her chest heave as she sighed, "If he is as handsome as his father I would find myself under a most fortunate star."

"I shall have to consult Madame Crackleroar..." his eyes shifted from side to side.

Clara outstretched her palms and gingerly took the rod from the merchant. Sighing in relief as she once again felt the crackling energy at her fingertips she exchanged a girlish grin with Marcus, somehow containing her giggling. They moved together to go through the motions of paying for the rod, with Marcus putting his money on the counter to help her afford the expensive magical rod. Unfortunately, while Mr. Marvelous was indeed forward in his advances, his claim of having a buyer was no lie, and the rod set the pair back 163gp. Clara had wanted to put a hold on the purchase, but Marcus stepped forward to finish the purchase with his own money.

Waving goodbye to Mr. Marvelous, Clara clasped the rod to her hip, and gingerly patted it as they left the shop. As they entered the street, Clara sucked in a lungful of air and let out a loud, frustrated sigh. "AaaaaAAARRgh!" Closing her eyes as she unfolded her parasol to keep the tropical sunlight off her skin. "I can't believe that rod cost over a hundred and fifty gold!"

Marcus span around and hushed her, "Hey hey, not so loud about that..."

Clara pursed her lips and threw her arms around his chest, "Ohh Marcus, why did you have to buy that for me? That was your money to spend on yourself! I would've figured it out somehow..."

Marcus shrugged, "Money doesn't mean much to me..."

"But you could've spent it for the orphanage... or..."

Marcus reached down, affectionately cupping her head as he brushed hair from her cheek, "Or I could've spent it on my friend," pulling her head against him, he kissed the crown of her head, "You do plenty for us Clara, you're always buying us carriages and sweet buns, and you always put your hand up whenever I need help. I depend on you, you depend on me."

"I'll pay you back..." Clara said softly into his chest, before letting go of the cuddle.

As she let go, a thought struck Marcus, "By the way, how did you know about that rod? He didn't exactly seem eager to advertise having it."

Clara turned to him, "Oh, a little pixie told me about it." Her head turned towards a bush, "And did I put on a good show, Quesoraxia?"

Shooting up from the bush and leaving a trail of sparkling dust, Quesoraxia the pixie alighted on Marcus' shoulder and giggled in her tiny, whistling voice. "Yes yes! Romance is in the air it seems, the portly little merchant boy! Our deception was quite well played indeed. Still the Marvelous man awaits for his mysterious patron clad in black. Not knowing that he was visited instead by pixies three! The rod of the pactkeeper ordered we for our dear fiddler of the glamorous court."

"There's romance in his fat little dreams perhaps..." Clara bit under her breath. "Why did you say you were going to buy it for one-hundred-and-fifty gold?!" She demanded of the little pixie.

Quesoraxia giggled fiendishly as she pushed a little finger against Marcus' cheek, "Well the season of love is here, and we need to sometimes give the hand of fate a little nudge." The pixie stood up on his shoulder to pat his head, "A debt can be a bond like any other, tying two souls together." With a tiny grin, Quesoraxia teased, "This one seems quite tall. You have exquisite taste in men, Clara. Good hearted and well built. If you don't want him I'll certainly have at least a taste or two of my own."

Clara scowled and pushed out her hand, blowing a gust of wind from her fingertips as she yelled "Oh Shoo! You stupid pixie!"

Marcus twisted to follow the creature's flight, he saw the pixie's butterfly wings fly against the sun and disappear. "What was that all about?"

Clara shook her head, "... Nothing..."

Marcus felt an easy smile cross his lips, "It's weird what she was talking about. You're like my sister anyway, why do people not see that?"

Clara smiled back, "And I love you like my brother!" causing both of them to smile.

"My shift on the wall is about to start," he said shortly, his hand resting easily on the pommel of his sword.

"I'm seeing the girls anyway, we're meeting at Tiv's over captain Yarlin," Shortly after, Clara said her farewell to Marcus. Mumbling under her breath as she walked away, "God... I'm such a twit sometimes..." 

---

Entering the room, or to be more accurate, entering the small clearing of junk that Tiv had more-or-less prepared as a room in his junkyard home, Clara was met by the gazes of Brittney and Meilin. They sat, cross-legged in the small junk clearing around the ever-smiling skull of Captain Yarlin. The room was perfectly bare, save for an old, gray woven rug that had more visible dirt on it than woll fibres. In the center was a small, raised pedestal on which the skull sat, the pedestal was formerly the top of some sort of rotating bar stool. Yarlin's perpetually mocking undead grin had demonically jagged teeth, and twin horns that jutted from the crown of his skull. While his eye sockets were perfectly void and black, small red pinpricks indicated where he was looking

"Oh, Ashna couldn't make it?" Clara asked the pair, to which Meilin shook her head.

"She said she was busy with some magic stuff," the monk shrugged. "I didn't really get it, but she said the cards didn't have this in her future anyway."

Clara looked to her side, "Seems convenient..."

Britt unfolded her legs and shot up, her devil's tail whipping up behind her, "Claarraaaa~ Was that a little bit of sass I heard?"

Clara couldn't suppress her giggle, and stepped forward to greet her friend with a hug, which was returned. Sitting next to Meilin, Clara embraced her as well. Bringing forward her bag, Clara started to bring out some breadrolls, "I had to get plain ones today, I had to spend most of my pocket money on a new rod I found..."

Meilin grabbed for a roll and started devouring it, "Oh don't worry about it Clara, you know we don't need you to bring rolls for us," she spoke around the giant lump of bread in her cheeks.

Clara smiled warmly and nodded, "Still, I like doing what I can,"

The skull in the center of their circle broke the friendly atmosphere of their gathering suddenly, as his raspy, crackling voice spoke from beyond the grave, "Just like that fiendish little bitch, the fields of plenty and bounty, unless it comes to old Yarlin! The pink haired, hook nosed, ugly old bitch! Pock marked flesh and haggard old clothes with a crooked, craggle tooth smile and yellow moles of flesh."

Britt clenched her teeth and shot her foot out to kick the skull's cranium, "Shut up, you stupid pile of bones. Don't you ever say anything useful?"

The skull wobbled, whatever magical, ethereal energy that animated it causing it to wiggle and turn to face Brittney. "Sweet, summer child, if you were ever betrayed by that crooked witch Titania, you would hate her as much as I."

Meilin stomped her foot, talking with her mouth full of bread, "Why can't you just get over it, it was over three hundred years ago!"

Yarlin snapped back furiously, "You little whelp. Lose all of your flesh and bones and we'll see how well YOU get over it!! I hate that bitch until the end of time itself. A thousand, no, a million thousand will be the number of curses on her and her family. I'll string her guts and hang her from her stupid, pink hair."

Britt scowled, "God you're such a bore."

Yarlin grinned, as much as a skull could communicate more than a fiendish grin, "Well why don't we complete the contract, then? There are questions to be asked and there's a curse to be broken, and you kids have five left! Why don't you simply ask how to shut me up?"

Frustrated, Brittany firmly put her heel against Yarlin's skull and kicked him off the pedestal again, "Why the hell would I ask something impossible?! I might as well ask how to win the damn lottery!"

With his eyesocket taking in dirt, Yarlin responded, "Well of course, I know that too, is that your question, my child?"

Clara picked Yarlin out of the dirt, and gently replaced Yarlin on his little pedestal as Britt responded, "I'm NOT related to you. Disgusting old skull."

Yarlin cackled, a sound that whipped out like lightning, causing Brittney to scream back, "Shut! Up!"  fiery magic flaring in her pupils, "Contract or no contract I will fucking end you!" her muscles tensing as she felt herself tracing the somatic components of her spell in her mind.

Clara moved next to her, and placed her hand on the tiefling's shoulder, "Britt, it's not worth it," she whispered quietly. 

Meilin gulped down her mouthful, "He's just a stupid skull, don't let him get to you."

Britt turned her head to look into Clara's expression, and felt her breathing get calmer. Clara spoke softly, "We signed a deal with him because he could help us save Masacoll. If you break it and get hurt... I don't know what... I'd be beside myself."

Closing her eyes, the tiefling took in a hard breath, "Right, so what are we doing here, again?"

Meilin piped up, "We're kissing him."

Britt turned to Meilin, "... Why... are we kissing him?"

"Because it's a curse of love," she responded quickly and matter-of-factly. "Ashna and Clara asked Nelly, and we learned there was a curse of love on Captain Yarlin. So maybe kissing him like in the fairy tales is the way to break it."

"SO PUCKER UP, LADIES!" Yarlin cackled fiendishly as he almost fell over in uproarious laughter. "Whatever that whore did to me in the fey wild, this curse isn't breaking itself!"

Brittney made a sound like her stomach was turning, looking over to Yarlin, "This thing makes me want to vomit."

After the girls had eaten their rolls, with the mocking devil skull being poor company, the task was at hand. The three girls looked between each other. "So... who first?" Britt broke the silence.

Clara quietly suggested, "We could spin it, and the one his eyes are looking at has to do it..?"

Britt heaved a sigh, "I'd rather just get it over with than do a game like that."

"Well, I don't wanna be here all night either. I'll just kiss the mugfuggen thing and get it over with." Meilin swallowed hard and crawled forwards towards Yarlin, "Reytarn's always talking about being strong in all situations."

"I'm not sure this is what he meant..." Clara whispered softly.

Meilin shrugged, "Look at it this way... it's kind of like eating bone-broth without the broth. I eat it all the time at home."

Clara twisted the hem of her dress nervously, as she watched Meilin bringing her lips down towards the singing skull. As the lips met his bone, she froze there for a moment. 

"THE WHORE! THE WHORE! THE STUPID, BITCHING WHORE!" Yarlin screamed furiously, startling Meilin and throwing her back.

"Gods, that scared the shit out of me!" the monk exclaimed, sitting back down and touching her chest to measure her heart.

Britt scowled, "Haven't you ever heard of decorum, Yarlin?! That's not the first thing you say when a girl kisses you!" Brittney clenched her teeth hard.

Yarlin wobbled and turned to Britt, "Look, it's not my fault, I hadn't complained about the DAMN WHORE that put me in this situation for five whole minutes! I was just bursting with RAGE!"

Brittney was shaking with anger as the knot in her stomach twisted and grew, "God... bloody damn you. You're such a frustrating, evil little thing. I hope you stay a skull forever."

Yarlin scoffed, "That wasn't the deal, little lady! whatever you need to do to break the curse, subsection 4 paragraph 6, clause I I I." Yarlin cackled gleefully.

With her fingernails digging into her palms, "I swear I'm going to... nnngh," Brittney looked over to Clara, who was starting to move towards the skull for her turn. "No," she said under her breath, and Clara stopped. "I'm not going to let your first kiss be to this little skull arsehole. I'll go next... and hope it fucking works..."

Moving over, Britt picked up the skull, turning it to its cranium and planting a quick kiss on the forehead. Gripping the sides of it harder, she did it again quickly, and then again and again. "God you fucking thing, why isn't this working?!" Frustrated, she threw Yarling as hard as she could against the dirt and kicked sand into it.

"Hey hey hey! Careful with the cranium! I don't want to get a crack in it!!" Yarlin yelled angrily. "SUBSECTION 4, PARAGRA-"

"EAT A DICK!" Britt screamed at him, sitting back down and folding her arms.

Clara once again picked up the skull, and set it down on its pedestal, looking at the devil captain, and then over to her two friends, "I'm sorry..."

"Clara, why are you apologising?" Meilin asked, "There's nothing here that's your fault."

Clara shook her head, "I don't even know. You both tried and it didn't work... I just felt bad."

Britt sighed, "Clara, sweety, what do I keep telling you," Britt looked deep into her friends' expression, "The world isn't your fault, or your thing to fix."

"I just don't like seeing you frustrated..." Clara tried to say.

Britt felt her temple with her finger, "Don't tell me how to feel, Clara, sometimes I just get frustrated."

Clara nodded, "I know..." Silence fell over the three for a moment, before Clara moved finally to put her hand on Britt's shoulder, which the tiefling held. 

"How touching, now kiss," Yarlin smirked. It was Meilin's turn to kick him over. Yarlin's voice raged as he once again started to cite the contract, "SUBSECTION 4--"

Ignoring him as he screamed into the dirt, Meilin and Britt both addressed Clara seriously. Meilin saying, "You don't have to if you don't want to, Clara,"

"It's not like it'll work anyway..." Britt put in. "We can just say you did it."

Clara shook her head, "No... I want to. I want to do everything I can."

Brittney shrugged, "Well, he's all yours then..."

"Don't think of it like a kiss," Meilin piped in, "Think of it like... tasting some of mum's bone broth,"

Clara looked over to the skull, and once again lifted it by the horns out of the dirt where Meilin had kicked it. Holding it on either side of its cheeks, she felt, as if for the first time, the ethereal, primordial, sticky undead goo that it seemed to be covered in. Like a thin membrane of incorporeal slime that covered it. It made her want to vomit. "Don't be too eager now!" Yarlin teased her.

Clara sucked in some air to settle her stomach, "Forgive me, captain Yarlin, but you are... quite literally a devil's remains. It's hard for me to bring myself to do this..."

"You don't have to apologise to it, Clara," Brittney said.

Clara looked to her, "But I don't want to hurt his feelings..?"

"It's an arsehole!" Brittney yelled. "The only thing **IT** feels is 'bitch this' and 'bitch that!'"

Clara looked back into the cold, voided eyesockets of the devilish skull, "Thinking of it as an arsehole isn't helping me kiss it, Brittney."

Clara closed her eyes, and brought her lips forward. as she did so, she felt the chill membrane of ethereal goop against her face and shivered from head to toe. "Euch, I'm sorry... could I have a minute?"

Meilin unfolded her legs to stand next to her, "What's wrong, Clara?"

Clara heaved a sigh, "I feel dumb... but... could I do this alone? It's gross enough as-is... but I don't want you both to see."

Brittney looked up to Meilin, before she joined in standing. "Whatever you need, Clara. Don't be too long, okay?" Clara nodded, and watched as her friends left to join Tiv in the adjoining clearing.

Yarlin hummed under his breath, tilting to the side in her hands, "Hmm... deception? Why do you deceive your friends, warlock?"

Clara's face dropped as she looked the skull in the eye, "It's not deception," she said firmly, "You are, in fact, very gross. But I realised why their kisses didn't work when I picked you up."

The devil's skull wore no expression, but Clara could hear the surprised inflection of his deep voice, "Oh? How interesting. Do share."

"It was the way they kissed you," she said simply.

Yarlin chuckled, "What do you mean... is there a difference in the way a stupid girl puts her mouth on me?"

Clara sat down, reaching out and putting the skull back on the pedestal in order to address it. "That's just it... You weren't made into this by just anyone, Captain Yarlin. You were put here by your lover, your dear Queen Titania. It's a lover's kiss you need to break this curse... not a peck on the forehead."

"Bollocks!" Yarlin shot back, "I've been in this damn mess for three hundred goddamn years, you think a teenage girl's lips is enough to break this magic?! I'm only entertaining this for my own amusement, you pink-haired bitch!"

"Excuse me?!" Clara exclaimed.

Even Yarlin felt his throat catch a lump from her outburst, "... Apologies," he said quickly, "After three hundred years of cursing Titania, that phrase just rolls off the proverbial tongue."

After a moment of silence, Clara picked up the skull again, and brought it closer. Yarlin spoke, "Why do you follow her, anyway?"

"I am just her musician," she responded simply.

"She doesn't love you, you know," he growled, "One day, your queen will throw you to her dogs, and laugh while you are mauled and spat out."

"I guess you would know," she said.

"Indeed."

Clara's eyes turned as she looked out to where her friends were waiting for her, and then back to the skull. "You know," he said, "It's not too late to sign another pact to an otherworldly patron,"

Clara looked back at him, "What do you mean?"

Yarlin grinned, "Otherworldly beings can transfer their pacts from one to the other. Trading warlocks like the little playing cards they are. I, in fact, used to have a few of my own, in my heyday."

"Why would I do that?" Clara asked. "And why would Titania? Why would you?"

"Titania would do it for amusement, or to be rid of my curses. One human life is a small price to pay for a devil's pacisifm. I would do it because I got to steal something from THAT PINK HAIRED BITCH!! And as for you... well..." He paused, to savour the moment, and the look of revulsion on Clara's face, "Because I can give you what your heart desires."

"I don't know what you mean..." Clara started to say.

"Ohh... don't you now?" Yarlin chuckled, a low, thrumming sound that punctuated the air. "Young girl, I have been around the block my fair share of times. I am adept at reading your mortal expressions, and although you try your damndest to hide it, to me your emotions are written on your face like a book."

Clara's brow furrowed, "Stop speaking in riddles. You're pissing me off."

Yarlin savoured the moment, "Ahhh, honesty. It's so refreshing seeing the 'real you' underneath all that politeness and shyness you put on around your friends. It must be so hard keeping up that facade. Or maybe you've been doing it so long, you wear that 'you' as a skinsuit, and it's harder to be honest?"

Clara hushed a whisper, "I AM honest!" she insisted.

Yarlin chuckled. "Then why whisper that? Why not tell them how you feel... hmm?" Clara clenched her jaw, and Yarlin allowed the tense silence to linger as she searched for a decent response. It was Yarlin who eventually broke the silence. "I've watched you from the day we met, young warlock, and watched how you talk to them. I'll make an interesting wager with you. Which one of the wardens of Masacoll does everybody assume that you're in love with?"

Clara tilted her head, side eyeing the skull, "What do you mean?"

"Of the wardens. When people speak of your friendship group, when people see you on the street, which of the five friends do all the passers-by assume that you're in love with?"

Clara broke eye-contact with him, "If it's your bet, shouldn't you tell me?"

Yarlin grinned, "Marcus." Clara nodded softly as he continued. "And it makes sense too! Everyone loves a fairy tale. The good-hearted orphan cum town guard striking it rich by winning the heart of the musical princess. Oh that's such a lovely story, isn't it?"

"Well they're wrong, and you're wrong too," Clara started.

Yarlin clucked his tongue, "Oh noooo, no no no. Shh little Clara. I see under your deception, and you can't fool me the way you fool the rest. You *use* Marcus. You use this fairytale and you use your friendship with him. You put him up like a shield because you know he'll always reject you, and reject this fairytale idea to others FOR you. For the truth is so... SO much more depraved, and so much more *delicious*."

"You're speaking nonsense."

Yarlin chuckled, "Come... come now, you can't hide it from me. My eyes see all. You don't JUST love Marcus. You love them all. Each of the five other wardens of Masacoll. You love Brittney, Meilin, Tiv, Ashna aas well as Marcus. All the same way, all at the same time."

Clara frowned, "Is that it? Is that your big revelation? I tell them I love them all the time!"

"Indeed. A brilliant deception in plain sight." Yarlin grinned, "But they don't know HOW MUCH! To what DEGREE you love them. They don't realise how serious you're being when you say that. They don't feel the gaping, yearning emotion you do when you reach out to them. They don't see the want in your eyes, the burning in your chest, how much you need them, you desire them. They don't see your fantasies the way I do. They don't see the way you so desperately want to taste them on your tongue."

Clara fell silent, her throat going dry as she looked away from the skull again, an unhappy feeling welling in her chest. Yarlin allowed her a moment, before speaking again, "Sign the pact with me, Clara. I will make the wardens of Masacoll yours, in every way you desire it. The 'adventure' will end, and you can live that debauched life you're yearning for. All six of you, together. Forever."

It was a long minute. Clara stared into a negative space in her mind. Not really in the room, but also not outside of it. A moment that lasted an eternity, until Clara finally said, "No."

"No? What do you mean 'No', don't tell me you're loyal to Titania?" Yarlin scoffed.

Clara shook her head, "Not Titania..." she said quietly. She looked down at the skull, "My friends... they wouldn't want me to say 'yes' to that."

"Who gives a rats!" Yarlin scowled, "You're not signing a pact with them, you're signing it with me! What about what you want?"

Clara shook her head again, "I love them as they are now... that life... what you described. It wouldn't be them. It would feel like them, look like them, but there'd be something missing. I need Tiv's toys, his playfulness, Ashna's clairvoyance and serenity, I need the look in Meimei's eyes, the way Britt talks to me so softly but nobody else, and I need Marcus' mission to help others... I need their... everything... to be happy."

Yarlin scoffed, "Hmph..." taking a moment, "Well it was worth a try. So be it! Let it be on your head then, if any of the wardens die in this adventure of yours, you'll always know I offered you a way to save them, and you didn't take it."

Clara sighed softly, stroking the cranium of the skull, "Don't even say such an awful thing, Yarlin. I trust my friends."

Yarlin twitched in her hand, side-eyeing her, "Your sweetness even gives me a tooth-ache," he scoffed. "I can at least tell you who'd be willing to knock boots with you if you tried it on... for the cost of your question, of course."

Clara felt herself giggle, and almost dropped the skull from laughing, "I'll be okay... thank you."

Yarlin grumbled softly, "If you're going to kiss me, you should do it quickly. The girls outside are getting antsy."

Clara tensed and swallowed her retort. She threw the last words she had to the back of her mind and brought the skull to her lips. Unlike Brittney and Meilin, however, Clara kissed Yarlin directly, where his lips ought to be if he still had skin. There was a cold, slimy, fleshy feeling on her lips as she closed her eyes. A thin membrane of ethereal goo pressing against her lips coldly. Holding either side of Yarlin's skull, she felt hair growing between her fingertips. With her eyes closed, she wasn't sure if this was her imagination.

Flesh, skin, warmth. Her lips were firmly locked with Yarlins and she felt a strong embrace as her head crooned back. He was tall. Enormously tall, and his giant frame wrapped around hers easily. His lips were hot and the kiss grew passionate, torrid. "Mmh," a sound escaped her throat. He pushed against her and snaked his tongue between her teeth. Her pulse quickened and her chest grew hot, yearning. His hands freshly exploring her body, down her back and all over her. Sensations were awakened all at once as the demon began to consume her like a lover, and she started feeling lost in the passionate embrace.

Clara's cheeks grew hot and her eyes went wide. Pulling back her arm suddenly she ***slapped*** Yarlin across his cheek, breaking the kiss and screaming, "KEEP YOUR GODDAMNED TONGUE TO YOURSELF!" Shoving him away, hard. Opening her mouth and licking her arm to try and rid herself of the taste of his mouth.

Britt and Meilin rushed in when they heard Clara screaming, but they were met with a pink-haired blur as Clara shoved past them, not able to look either of them in the eye. A very stunned, very tall and very naked devil captain was dazed in the dirt, looking up at the pair. The red devil was tall and broad, with crimson red flesh and pitch black eyes, yellow pupils glowing within.

"Holy fuck it worked..." Brittney said breathlessly. Turning to Meilin, she said, "Can you go..?"

"On it!" Meilin disappeared to run after Clara, leaving Brittney alone with the newly formed devil.

"As for you..." Brittney felt her momentary shock giving way to an intense, furious anger, "Why exactly did Clara just run out of here crying?"

Yarlin himself was still reeling, looking over his hands and flexing his toes, "Haha... I can't believe it... Three hundred years. The little girl actually did it." He marvelled at his fingernails, felt his abdomen. "Skin.. hair... organs... I can feel my kidneys! I have a tail."

"EXCUSE. ME." Brittney's eyes started to glow a fiery red, "I believe I asked you a question."

"Oh whatever, she's just a little surprised. She'll be fine." he started inspecting his body with his hands, locking his fingers together and feeling the bones, "The curse, the curse! The bitch's curse is lifted!"

Tracing the somatic components in the air, Brittney furiously finished the incantation, and threw a cloud of daggers at Yarlin, "DIE! YOU PIECE OF SHIT! WHY IS CLARA CRYING?!"

Yarlin yelped in surprise and threw his arms up to defend himself from the blades. ducking his head under and rolling out of the spell's radius. The cutting winds like steel smarting over his flesh and opening up wounds. Transporting himself behind the tiefling bard, he cleared his throat. "That hurt. I have nerves! Oh this is delicious, I can feel pain again!"

Brittney span on her heel, looking up to pointedly look in the devil's black eyes. "That's not even the start of it! One more time now. Why the hell was Clara crying?! What did you do?"

Yarlin looked at his fingernails dismissively, "Oh don't worry. I answered you already, she's just surprised. I kissed her back. A very amusing reaction you had though. hot headed little Brittney, ready to break a devil's contract for her little Clara. We'll call that a glitch, perhaps. Let's say you were just testing the nerve endings in my newly grown body. Or maybe you thought I'd broken my end of the deal and hurt your friend."

Brittney felt an angry fire in her heart, and a fire circling her fingertips as she side-eyed the devil. "What the hell were you two talking about for so long, anyway..?"

"Secret." Yarlin said simply, "Unless you're willing to spend a question, my lips are sealed..." he moved his fingers to his black lips suddenly to lick them, and then drew his tongue across his lips, "Oh! Cherry! I can taste?! That young Clara must have been wearing a cherry balm on her lips after all. What a delightful little girl she is. Such a good kisser too!"

Britt drew her head back and screamed, thaumatalurgically lifting her voice as loud as possible.
