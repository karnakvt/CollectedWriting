# A Tale Before The Seelie Court

Deep in the gloaming twilight, with the ringing of sweet song in her ears, Clara opened her eyes to a small clearing in a thick, viridian forest. Swirling about her head in the heavens above were stars that faded from visibility, leaving contrails of sparkling light in their wake. a falling orange moon dominated the distant horizon and splashed the mulberry purple sky with its fiery presence. Ancient wood all around her that illuminated from an ethereal, blue-purple fungal light.

A mist beyond the trees thick like soup, such that ghosts and wisps peeked at her in and out of existence as fast as a blink. Motes of dust caught by zephyr gusts that moved as though they were alive. Eyes that glowed mischievously in the darkness between darknesses. The most telling feature of her surroundings was the kaleidoscopic colours of the garden under her toes. Vibrant greens and blues, dotted by yellow and purple flowers. Neon and bright, nauseating and sickly. The fresh smell of honey on her nose mixed with strange herbs like cinnamon. The buzzing of insects in her ears mixed with laughter and song. Everything Familiar, everything out of place.

As she turned and looked around, she was greeted by a sparkling little insect-woman. Wings beating so fast that they blurred into a white illusion, the sound and soft wind from the beating of her wings assaulting Clara's senses. A purple skinned pixie, with tiny lizard scaled on her shoulders and cheeks. Despite these alien features, she appeared as a fairly attractive woman, with short hair, a button nose and high cheekbones. She spoke with a voice that slashed the veil of silence like a dagger. A shrill pitched,  tin whistle, "You're not dressed!" she was no larger than a palm, and yet she scolded Clara with her hands on her hips, her entire body swaying with the surrounding breeze that she was flying in, like a bumblebee.

Clara laughed, "Hardly!" Leaning forward to shoot back, "It's called a nightdress. It's what we wear to bed at home."

The pixie clucked her tiny tongue, summoning her other sisters that zipped and zoomed around her, "You call those clothes?! You're barely dressed at all for court, and where's your violin? You're hardly a fiddler fit for the queen without a violin, aren't you?"

"Am I going to court, am I?" As they talked Clara followed the pixie's motions with her head. The other pixies busied themselves attending to Clara's dress by dressing her more appropriately for the feywild. With deliberate and fast movements, they wrapped her in a giant version of the pixies' own formal dress made from leaves, branches and flowers. Large leaves hung together, sewn by threads made of twigs and thorny vines, that gently brushed her skin but didn't cut into it. It ended in a skirt that came down to her thigh, and cynched at the waist with a broad, silk ribbon made of spiderweb that was dyed pink. Even though it didn't make much sense for the human girl, the dress was open at the back, for pixies always left room for wings. In the popular fashion of the feywild, her hair was meticulously messed up and lifted with twigs and branches, the wild, pink mane looked as if she'd been rolling around in a pile of sticks and mud and threaded with blue flowers. She was not to wear shoes, and her feet were coated in a thick mud that stuck between her toes and up her ankles like socks.

"'tis a private audience, Clara, for whatever gods-forsaken reason she wishes an audience with her entertainer. Whatever happened to the last costume we gave you?" the pixie continued to chide.

"Well if you wouldn't abduct me from my dream I would have more time to prepare for her majesty," Clara said simply.

"You should always be prepared for an audience with our queen. Who are you to be so casual with her, hmm? Every time I look at you I see nothing but a scurrilous little whelp. Wet around the ears with a big sad expression all day. 'Clara the timid', 'Clara the miserable', 'Clara the scared', 'Clara the precious little dear'" The pixie squeaked angrily. Despite the high pitch of her voice, there was a keen edge to her words and criticism. 

"I'm just a humble girl with a fiddle and bow," Clara shot back nonchalantly as the pixies finished messing up her hair. Lifting her finger to stab the little pixie in the stomach, she grinned "And you, Quesoraxia, are a pixie with a tongue like thorns but a heart of silver," Clara wriggled the finger to tickle her, which the pixie responded with uproarious laughter. Clara laughed along, "Thank you, each of you," she twirled to try and spy all of the pixies as they flitted away. She held her palms open as if asking for alms, and Quesoraxia landed delicately, "Especially to you, darling Raxia. My dress is lovely. I don't know what I'd do without you."

The pixie huffed, folding her arms, and shouting, "I just don't want you to lose your head over a silly thing like forgetting your clothes!"

"I know, shall we go?" Walking forward through the din of mist, Clara followed fairylights in the distance as they danced among the trees, suspended in the dimness of the weald around her. She strode with large steps. Wanting to go faster and faster, until her gait turned to a jog, a run, and finally an energetic sprint. Her legs carried her tirelessly as boundless energy swelled her stomach, and seemed to lift her. Before long she felt a weightless sensation in her stomach and looked down to see the ground disappear.

Following the dancing lights around her, she was guided by the dull white light  of Quesoraxia's sparkling wings. Following it with her legs, she found that her toes had no grip on any dirt, and she seemed to be propelled by an energy that coiled around her like a spring. The edge of the mist in front of them, Quesoraxia and her sisters barreled through the membrane of what appeared to be a giant raindrop at full speed. One by one their lights snuffed out, until even Quesoraxia could no longer be seen. Closing her eyes and holding her breath, Clara braced herself for impact, and plummeted into the large raindrop herself.

Bursting into the Seelie court from above, Clara heard the booming voice of the caterpillar that was announcing their arrival. "... And of course, Quesoraxia's sisters are accompanied by our lovely court fiddler and new entertainer, the young maid Clara Steibelt, of the 'good and proper' realm of mortals and other such mundane nonsense."

Arriving in the court, Clara found herself before a small party of fey creatures. Noble and fantastic. The blue skinned firbolg  chief, with white fur over his chest. The king of Leprechauns to his right, three harengon wise men to their left. Clara had learned many of their faces, but could pronounce few of their names. As with all of Titania's warlocks, toys, guests and curiosities, she was regarded by them as a mild curiosity, if not a distracting amusement. 

Clara landed, and the ephemeral wings that had carried her to court dissipated in the mist. Attempting a courtly curtsy in the middle of the room, she instead pulled some of the leaves off her dress and giggled fiercely at the embarassment.

The queen herself was amused by this display, and outstretched her hand. "Clara," Titania's eyes were dark beads of night, like an insect, her cheekbones high and promiment, lips thin though smiling. Despite having the presence of a being many thousands of years old, she didn't have a single wrinkle on her green-yellow skin. Hair like branches flowing behind her. To her left was king Oberan. High overlord of the feywild and leader of the Seelie court, though it was understood where the true power of the throne lie.

"Your song earlier this evening was most entertaining." Titania spoke softly, though her voice reverberated powerfully. 

"You heard it..?" Clara asked curiously.

Titania nodded, "I made sure to catch it when the music was in the air, Elysriaxus provided a divination for us to listen," A small creature nearby made a haughty 'harumph' as he thrust his large nose into the air

"I am delighted that it pleased you, your majesty." Clara responded with a bow of her head.

Titania smiled gently, as a summer sun would smile to a small meadow, "Like a babe tugging for feed, I have also felt you using the magic we gifted you.  We understand that after your performance you had a most," she looked to the alien, courtly members on her left, "Delightful little adventure."

Clara affirmed, "I did, your majesty. Everyone was so brave, it was remarkable."

"I am in the mood for a tale, dear." Titania said simply.

Clara turned to Quesoraxia, who had perched on her shoulder and flew away to give her room to perform. The shrill whisper of the pixie's voice hit Clara's ear, but was soft enough for it to go beneath Titania's notice. "Make it a good one, Clara," Quesoraxia whispered urgently, "Our queen is not in a good mood. She ripped a goblin juggler in two before you came."

Clara simply smiled confidently, "Well that's certainly one way to halve your entertainment budget." Looking to Titania with a cheeky smile, "Half the goblin only needs half the food, right?"

A snortle came from an elderly eladrin man to her right, and Clara smiled to him warmly. Titania's  features were stony and cryptic.

Clara went silent for a moment, and there was a heaviness to the air as her thoughts ordered the events of the evening. Feeling the wonderous magic of the feywild around her, limericks and poetry swam through her head. Sonnets and ballads, songs of triumph, loss and woe. fey performances were beautiful, and heavily improvised. Even though it was her first time doing such a thing, the magic of the realm around her bolstered her oration, and gave her an unnatural calm as she spoke of the wardens of Masacoll.

>"The night was filled with love and venture
>
>Hearts drew near as the prince's love drew close
>
>Jealous eyes to Meilin were lured
>
>And down to the floor went they after blows;"


>"Fiercely we danced, and merrily we jigged
>
>And to Ashnar a man was sent
>
>But old Julius had his plans zigged
>
>And that man found his toes... quite bent;"

Clara nodded assertively. As she spoke the rhymes, the magic of the feywild showed images above her head of Ashnar purposefully stomping on her dancing partner. As well as the magical dance between Meilin and Willem Gylden.

>"Up from the sky the blue woman came
>
>Down to the earth the Fell creature crashed
>
>Into his chest the trident was aimed
>
>But dead he was not, despite his gash;"


>"Summon did he, more guests for us
>
>Dance did we, for jollity was the law
>
>With smiles and mirth, in their hearts we thrust
>
>Zombies, brutes, and a mighty Tyrannosaur;"

Distorted images of battle surrounded her. The terrible battle they fought against the zombies and Ben GoldBleed. Clara's face twisted in worry, despite the rhyme being "smiles and mirth" guards were slain left and right. Marcus was shown sprinting desperately to save Karl, stabbing his dagger into the undead over, and over again. A bleak look on their faces.

>"We thought him cold, so we warmed him up,
>
>With magic, spells and slings we played
>
>A fire so bright it filled our cup
>
>With our own Reytarn forming a blockade;"


>"O what friends we made, in battle most fair
>
>O what joy we felt as we danced our souls away
>
>Out, the lizard went to the square
>
>With bits of a mentor's shoulder, always time to play!"

Images of Reytarn's fierce struggle against the titanic dinosaur, the T-Rex taking a chunk of the monk's shoulder. Tiv's ingenious plan to immolate the beast, and Clara's desperate, tearful pleading to try and get the frightened animal to safety. Britt's final plea to Reytarn as the beast crashed through to the courtyard. Clara's breathless cries of fury as she shot eldritch magic at the foul undead.

>"Alas, alas, it was time to go
>
>And to other houses we went
>
>To spread the host's party favo'
>
>To the Goldbleeds were we sent;"


>"Marcus did Julius betray
>
>A prank most lively and boisterous
>
>For love did Karl take Marcus his way
>
>Their fun would be so Roisterous;"


>"Some guests we found
>
>Their carriage warm and golden
>
>They belong now to the Burial Ground
>
>To their coffins we were beholden;"

The aftermath of the party. Arguments with Julius, Clara's frustration and repressed rage. The tearful faces of the frightened guests, and the panic that was on everyone's expression. The clear fatigue that was on Lady Esmerelda's face. Marcus taken in shackles despite committing no crime. The grim adventurers rushing to the next scene, only to be confronted with the burning corpses inside the carriage, desperately struggling to aid the one survivor.

>"The Celestes must have been quite cold
>
>For their party they had all together decided
>
>To set fire to their whole damn household!
>
>Perhaps their plan was a... touch misguided?"

Clara laughed, and the fey court all joined her uproariously as gruesome images of the thirty dead bodies hung over her head. The desperate struggle to save who they could. Tiv's masterful plan to burst the water pipes. Clara's clear look of fear and distress as she coughed in the smoke filled building. Following Britt's lead as they made their way through the maze of death.

>"And all this was ere I met
>
>my guard in rusted armour
>
>Alfonse Chadwet
>
>Fell did I, for that little charmer;"


>"And so with the household all dead
>
>On we went to the Goldbleed's manse
>
>Alas! They too were dead
>
>What rotten luck! How low the chance!"


>"With the moon hanging low
>
>My friends gathered around me
>
>To home we did go
>
>Speaking fondly of this night of merry."

The final images circled through. The aftermath of the fire at the Celeste's. The expression on Clara's face when she realised they may be targeting noble houses. Brittney's worried conspiracies as they talked about the terrible events of the evening. The fatigue on Ashnar's and Meilin's faces as they walked. The final image was Clara's shellshocked face as she trembled in the cold of the night.

Clara bowed graciously and the fey court erupted into applause from the boisterous performance. Hands clapped together as Mugwoggens slapped their tables, spriggans hooked arms and danced around and the leprechaun lit his corn pipe.

Titania beamed in pride, "A fine performance, dear!" she said, as Quesoraxia once again alighted on Clara's bare shoulder. 

Clara smiled cheekily, "So I won't be getting halved then, your majesty?"

"I don't know what I would do if I had two of you!" Titania shook her head, "No, no. That's quite alright. You have indeed excelled as my fiddler, and you've managed to harness the wild magic quite admirably to perform with such audacity."

Clara smiled proudly, with her chest lifted as the queen continued, "You've taken quite well to the feywild's magic, and so I think it's time to present you with your next gift..."

With that, the queen rose from her chair, and the table she was sitting at was pulled to the side by servants, so that she could approach the young warlock. In Titania's hands she presented Clara with three small items. A book that seemed to swirl with human flesh, a small chain, and a dagger.

"... Shall we discuss your pact, dear?"

Clara smiled brightly as her heart leapt into her chest, "Yes, please!!" and with childlike energy, she jumped forwards to embrace the queen of summer, burying her face in Titania's chest as she squeezed her patron tightly.
