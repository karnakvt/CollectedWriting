# A Night at Sea

Meilin's face was illuminated by the glow of orange candlelight as she smiled up towards Willem. Her large, almond eyes reflecting a smile that they shared as they looked at each other. She found her eyes darting between his, the old romantic adage of feeling lost in a man's gaze sitting in her mind. Her hands grew clammy in Willem's and he, in turn, felt his cheeks ache as his smile grew wider. A dizzying, aching happiness in her chest that made her heart race and her feet trip over each other. He was already a lad with an easy smile and a twinkling blue expression, but it became even easier when he got to look at Meilin. 

Their hands were clasped and slowly they encircled one another. The steps of the traditional dance, 'The Wharfman's Daughter' saw them circling and twirling as they traded partners and swayed to an alternating two-step and three-step beat. It was a moment that seemed to last forever, even though it would soon end. One which promised many more like it. Letting go at the top of the melody, Meilin stepped forward and lifted her other hand to dance with Marcus, and Willem with Ashnar. On their ankles, the dancers wore bells, adding claps in appropriate timing to the music.

The melody was, of course, provided by the performers of their troupe. The lyrics proudly sang by Brittney as she kept rhythm and chords with her lute. The tiefling's red tail flicking and swaying with the motions of her body. The raunchier parts of the song, such as, "He'd drink a little then a lot / So he'd never have a shot / When I'd kiss the Wharfman's daughter!"  were sung with a cheeky grin and slightly off key to emphasise them. The top of the chorus prompted a spirited violin solo from Clara, whose long pink hair swayed like a metronome in the Autumn night's air. The candlelit illumination and music providing a soft magic to the adolescents and young adults dancing.

Every so often, the motion of the boat would assert itself. The creaking wood and the sounds of splitting water adding a fresh ambience to the old folk tune. As the solo came to a resolution, Clara looked to Brittney to pick up her time and she was met with Brittney's usual "Good job" wink of her fiery devil's yellow eye.

It was a night of frivolity for the eight young adults. Thoughts of responsibility, thoughts of adventure and the heavy thoughts of the terrible crimes they'd seen or the enemies they'd face were set aside for one evening. An evening where they could once again recapture their feelings from only a few months ago. Before wardenship, before the Sea Elves, before the murders and before the likes of Ben Goldbleed would ruin their evenings.

Looking suddenly to her left, Ashnar thought for a moment before she beckoned Cybil to take her spot in the circle. Carefully, she picked her way out and around the other dancers to look for the smallest of the wardens. She made sure to sweep her dragon's tail as she walked, so that it wouldn't bump the railings of the ship, or get trod on by Marcus' footwork. 

About an hour ago Tiv had been playing along with a tambourine while everyone danced and was himself enjoying some sweet citrus fruits. However, the barrel where the small kobold had been sitting was now conspicuously empty, with the black tambourine simply resting there without an owner. Nothing but a small stash of pomegranate peels was left as evidence for his maurauding hunger. As Ashnar moved behind the barrel, she caught Clara's eye, who smiled in return and kept playing.  

The little draconic creature was mumbling under his breath in the darkness as his head pushed forwards in absolute focus. Around his head was a jeweller's headband. A leather strapped device which had magnifiers held out by small metallic arms delicately held in front of his right eye. Tiv was using four layers of magnification as he worked. In the kobold's hands were a cauterising iron pen which steamed with heat, and an obsidian gem that seemed to glow with a deep purple light.

A small workshop of sorts was set up around him on the deck. Layed out around him was a large, dark, hemp cloth on which he was sitting. Delicate gears, devices and contraptions and twisted bits of metal and tools were arrayed out in every direction, just within arms reach if he should need any of them. While a lot of it looked like repurposed scrap metal, Ashnar knew better than to label Tiv's "Treasures" as junk. Looking on curiously was the small pseudodragon that had recently joined them, who seemed to feel he was helping by holding some tool or other in his mouth. Slobbering all over it.

"How is it coming along?" Ashnar's words were quiet, in her usual cadence.

Tiv's motions were quick, his head flicking startled as he adjusted to the shadow looming over him. His right eye was magnified over a hundred times, and the usual red lizard's eye was tinted green due to the tint of the magnifying lens. Catching his breath after the fright, Tiv flicked up the magnifiers and asked "Why you here? You should be dansssing!" Tiv's usual draconic accent was thick, and it emphasised the kobold's elongated ess'. 

Finding a spot that looked mostly bare, Ashnar knelt inside Tiv's ad-hoc workshop, sitting roughly across from him. As she did so, Brittney suddenly howled, "Cybil!! The-" followed by a loud commotion as Cybil's tremendous blue frame made the entire decking vibrate as he crashed to the floor. The music suddenly stopped as everyone rushed over to fuss over him.

"I suddenly had the feeling that I ought to come see you instead of dance..." Ashnar responded simply over the din of excitement. Dragonborn snouts typically had difficulty expressing the broad range of emotion that the others were capable of with lips and delicate facial muscles, however, the way Ashnar moved her head told that she was attempting to hide a small chuckle from the commotion. Despite her efforts, Tiv could easily read Ashnar's pride that she felt when a premonition came true. Looking over the barrel to make sure they were okay, she saw that Marcus had already pulled that the firbolg up on his feet with a strong arm and they were laughing about the tumble, "You sure you haven't had the drink already?!"

"Soft like a cushion!" Cybil burst into laughter.

Ashnar returned her attention to Tiv as their friends talked and the music soon restarted. The kobold was already rotating the small gem in his tiny claws, inspecting his work. "And what about you, Tiv? You normally like to play along with Britt and Clara."

"I distracted..." Tiv said, not lifting his eyes from his work, "Idea. Ssstrong idea..." Finding it hard to focus on the conversation, Tiv's tongue hissed the words as it tasted the air.

Ashnar leant in, to try and discern what Tiv was seeing, though Tiv's vision was better in the darkness than hers. From what she could make out, Tiv had managed to write a small amount of script on the tiny gem.

Tiv didn't have to be prompted to explain. "Look look, see? This is heart of Gimlet." Tiv held the obsidian gem up closer to the light for Ashnar to see. "Before I have problem. Weave flux everywhere. Some places flux weak, some places flux strong. Need ssstrong energy source to move Gimlet. Those  places with weak weave, maybe Gimlet just stop. What I do then? How do I recharge gem when battery is dry and no weave, hmm?"

Ashnar shook her head, "I mean, I understand the principle, but the writing is too small for me to make out here."

Tiv immediately unclasped his headband and gave Ashnar the gem, wrapping the strap around the dragonborn's skull, under the horns and setting up the magnifiers. "Look look. See? I solve it. I solve weak flux problem. I carve in primary solution on north facet." Indicating with his claw the approximate place for her to look.

The delicate handiwork of the gem was a masterwork of intricate weaving. As Ashnar turned the gem slowly in her claws she started to see the carefully scribed glyphs and runes that had been slowly and deliberated etched on every surface. Following where Tiv indicated with his claw, he explained. "I use 'Ral' here, charge with 'Zot' and anchor with 'Gith'," 

Ashnar shook her head, "Ral'Zot'Gith' isn't a valid combination of weaving runes..."

"You no consider the gem alignmentsss," Tiv said excitedly, his tail slapping on the decking. "What way gem facing?"

"... North..."

Tiv grinned, "Which domain control North?"  

Ashnar's scales around her eyes creased as Tiv spoke cryptically, "..Ice..?"

"Rune for Ice?"

Ashnar's jaw fell as she looked again at the rune etchings on the gem, "'Kah''Min''Zot''Gith''!" She exclaimed. "Because 'Ral' changes based on the connected domain..?"

Tiv nodded proudly. "I figure this! Should work, yesss?"

Ashnar considered the solution, "Well yeah... I mean. That combination makes basic kinematic energy. It's part of Mage hand and Tenser's disc." Furrowing her brow, she considered for a brief moment biting her tongue, in case her words came out as criticism. "But this will never work! It depends on the gem facing northward, so it'll only be correct as long as Gimlet never turns... as soon as he turns west the runes will be wrong..."

Tiv reached up to snatch the gem back, turning it over in his hand, "Yes yes yesss. Problem problem. I still ssstuck on that one..."

Ashnar watched as the kobold grumbled. His brow furrowed and his back slightly hunched. She found herself admiring the small lizardfolk. "We've watched you grow from an egg. It's remarkable that you came up with an idea like that."

"It no big deal. I study, I fiddle, I tinker, things work." Tiv said dismissively, before sitting back down to consider his problem. "Sometimes Reed help. Sometimes I get idea from ssseeing you guys."

Ashnar tilted her head "Seeing us?"

Tiv nodded, gesturing with his claw, he drew sigils across the cloth underneath them. "Britt fire, strong head, big heart." Drawing with his claw, he traced a runic outline, "When she angry she look like 'Tral', hand on hipsss and head forward." He looked over to the dancers, "Meilin. She's rock. Meilin's practice kata has her armsss posture in three posesss." Drawing sigils, "See? 'Bel' 'Narn' and 'Zot'. Now combing with Britt's 'Tral'"

"... Burning hands..." Ashnar said quietly.

Tiv nodded. "Needs strong handsss. Fire in heart. This is how I remember burning hands. I didn't need book to tell me thisss. People shape themselves like weave, trace out sigils with the way they talk, the way they sit, the way they move. Gives me ideas for magic." Then, reaching up, he pressed his sharp claw next to Ashnar's temple, "Clear mind. Seeing through time like it's glassss. Ashnar is like wind."

Ashnar chuckled softly, "It is sometimes a curse,"

Tiv nodded, "Neverthelessss, I see all things like this. You see through time, I see through mechanics. I see gears all mix together. Levers all pull each other and wheels turning. Making a big huge machinery. In our family, in all of us we are like gears as well. You, me, Meimei, Marcusss, Britt, Clara. We fit together like gears and we turn each other. We understand each other and protect each other. Even though we from different clutch, different hatching, different parents. We one family." Tiv paused for a moment to clasp his fingers together, looking at Ashnar in his earnest way, "Universe is machine that brought gears together. I see a big machine, and from that I pull out a little one. Just a toy or a trap. You say is amazing. I say not true. The amazing thing is the universe, I just make a little toy or I see a little thing in it."

Ashnar sat in silence as she listened to Tiv. The surprisingly deep and sentimental insight was quite unlike him. She let a few potential reasons turn around in her head before she finally said, "Well in any case it's still amazing that you're able to figure out how to get Gimlet to move."

Tiv had already returned to inspecting the obsidian gem, and mumbled, "Thank you."

Turning her head slightly, she leaned forward, "Actually... about your problem." Tiv looked up in rapt attention, flicking up the microscopic lenses. "Have you considered, you don't need Gimlet to always be facing north... just the gem?"

"What you mean?" Tiv asked, "Gimlet turn and gem turn..."

Ashnar hummed softly, "Hrm, I've seen Nelly use something like it... I think she called it a sunflower gyroscope. No matter what way you turn it, it was always facing the direction of the sun."

Tiv was quiet for a moment while he processed this information, but more and more his tail started thumping wildly. "If gem in sunflower scope. I make it point north like lodestone. Then no matter which way gimlet turn head, he charged." Tiv stoop up, excited and put his hands on Ashnar's shoulders, looking deep into her eyes, "Sunflower gyroscope you say? What it like? What it do? How to mount gem in sunflower scope?"

Ashnar began stumbling over the answers to the rapidfire questions, but her attention was suddenly jolted by the sound of Brittney slapping the large barrel behind her. "Yo Ashnar, Tiv!" The tiefling's white fangs flashing in the candlelight as her visage was shrouded in darkness of shadow, "Are you coming below deck for some rounds?" With a flick of her wrist, Brittney held up three of the ornate cards that both of them instantly recognised.

Arcane: Rising was a card game that the wardens had been playing together ever since they discovered it five or six years ago. Being imported from the mainland, the kids grew interested in it when they saw some magic students playing it on the dockside. Supposedly the game was designed originally as educational material, so that the Wizards of the mainland would have a tool to teach young scholars about the interplay between runes and energy. Over time however, the students took on the game as a means of passing the time and as an intellecual exercise in developing and breaking the system. Eventually, yearly competitions were held to design new and fun game mechanics, decks and monsters to play with. 

By the time the old wizards were ready to show the game to other schools, they found that the updated rulesets from the students were much more popular than their own, both with the students of other schools and their own peers. Giving up on the educational aspects of demonstrating runic subsystems, the wizards instead simply endorsed the game as "A fun and somewhat scholarly activity that might at least be able to teach you good sportsmanship," and published the rulesets and card sets widely for everyone to enjoy.

Tiv's tail thumped excitedly as he clapped his hands, "Ohh yes yes! Arcane: Rising time it is!" Spinning around quickly, he almost barrelled over the pseudodragon that was still gnawing on his tools. "I have big big combo. You see! You see!" Twirling around, Tiv immediately started folding his burlap cloth to pack up his workshop, prompting Ashnar to quickly move out of his way and stand up next to Brittney. 

"What about you, Ash?" Brittney grinned up towards the dragonborn.

"I'll never turn down a good game of Arcane," Ashnar said simply, "It's exciting not being able to see the outcome. Did everyone bring their decks?" Since the game was designed for magic students, official cards had warding against low-level or subconscious divination

Brittney leant against the barrel, her tail kicking up, "Well it'll be Cybil and Willem's first game, but Clara packed extra cards in her ridiculous chest, so we should be good to play with everyone."

"Splendid." With that, the wardens made their way beneath the main deck. Before disappearing down the stairs, Cybil took a quick, habitual glance at the black surroundings, and double checked the boat's heading against Gelwar's Belt.

Brittney passed him by, grabbing his shirt, "You comin' or not?"

Cybil laughed, "Just realised it was almost nine-bells, so I had to check the heading. We're still fine."

"It's fine it's fine! Come play games!! You're such a stick in the mud." Feeling the insistent little tiefling, he laughed and ducked his head as he went below deck.

Below deck, everyone had busily made haste to prepare the space for playing games. Tables were unfolded and unpacked from the ship's hold and latched to the floor. Marcus proudly pulled barrels from the hold with Meilin as they set them out. Clara rifled through her chest to find the extra decks of cards, while Ashnar and Tiv set up game boards.

With the creaking wooden ship all around them, the conversation bubbled between them as they reminisced and spoke of older times. Spot and Dart were playing chase around their ankles, darting between their legs. Hanging on the large wooden pillars, the candle lanterns were throwing out a soft orange glow that allowed everyone to see. The sounds of cards shuffling and jokes being swapped with laughter. Their sleeping hammocks strung up in the darkness behind them. Arrayed on the tables were some rolls, dried meats, nuts and fruits that they'd packed for the first night. As well as Clara's carefully preserved and unwrapped sweetrolls coated in pink sugar that she pilfered from her kitchen.

Marcus stood up, lifting his flagon, "Does everyone have their drink?" Heads turned to him and smiled. The young man's dark hair hanging over the rough tan skin as he flicked it out of his eyes. Wearing only his simple brown tunic, and the old cotton breeches cynched at the waist, the young man's arms and shoulders were exposed. The budding musculature on his chest, as well as his wide bones and large frame belied the strength and size of the man he was quickly growing into.

"Tonight we're lifting our cups to our good friend Willem Gylden." Marcus projected. "Since your last birthday party was interrupted, we thought we could have our own out here." 

"Here here!" Meilin's voice chimed as she raised her mug high.

"Willem," Marcus turned to face the red haired lad. In terms of looks the two were worlds apart. Despite Willem being older, the lines on Marcus' young face, and the way his angular jaw seemed to make his teeth grind gave the young fighter an older presence than the slightly plumper nobleman. "A few months ago, I joined the barracks under the commander," he said slowly. "And growing up, I always thought that I'd be scrapping through these streets by myself... only relying on myself."

"I've looked at so many ceilings over the years, waking up from sleep," he said, looking down for a moment to his drink, where he spied his own reflection, "And every time I'd see a new one, I'd wonder how long it's going to last. Whether it's the orphanage, a bunk, or a base I've made myself." He looked up, sweeping his gaze across all the faces before him, "But now, the lonely days by myself seem like a bad memory. Meeting all of you, one by one. You've all been so nice to me and taken me in..." he found himself swallowing hard, "... Thank you." Swirling images in his mind, memories of races with Meilin, finding things for Ashnar, playing with Tiv's toys swirling in his mind. "I never really had much of a family," he said thoughtfully, "but if this is what it feels like... then... it's pretty nice," with that, Marcus raised his flagon, and everyone followed suit, "For Willem Gylden's birthday!" Bumping the wooden cups together before cheering, they downed the hot, stinging alcohol.

Clara only took a mouthful before she started dry coughing and Ashnar quickly patted her back. "Are you alright, dear?"

Clara caught her breath, nodding, "It's surprisingly..." sucking in a thick ball of air, "Tangy?"

"Isn't this your first time drinking, Clara?" Meilin  called from the other table.

Clara shook her head, "Mm no, Papa lets me have wine after dinner to get a taste for it." Adding, in a slightly deeper voice to imitate her father, "'A Steibelt ought to have a tongue for the finer things...'"

Cybil laughed, "Well, sailor's rum is probably a lot rougher than whatever you're drinking."

Clara's porcelain cheeks flushed red as she hung her head, pink hair falling over her face to hide its shape. Suddenly embarassed from speaking out of turn. Brittney quickly corked Cybil's arm with a balled fist, "Oi! Apologise."

Cybil flinched and looked at the tiefline, "Ow! What for? I didn't do nothing!"

Brittney's gaze flicked quickly over to Clara before she glared daggers at the giant firbolg, "Nothing my red arse! Apologise!"

Meilin stifled a giggle next to Willem, who looked at her inquisitively. Meilin looking over to him, "Nothing makes Britt madder quicker than seeing that look on Clara's face."

Willem looked towards the now frantically apologising firbolg and the furious tiefling and felt a smile draw across his lips. "He barely spoke two words to her though, how do you guys all talk to her?"

Meilin shrugged, "Mm, she'll warm up to you eventually. I actually thought she was a mute that only talked through her violin when I first met her. She just sort of followed Britt around everywhere. Took her a year and a half before she managed to speak to me... wanna know what she said?" Willem nodded, rapt in attention. Meilin leaned forward, conspiratorially, he held up her hand to whisper privately, "'Where's the bathroom?'"

Willem snorted and started laughing into his hand, and Meilin along with her.

The night continued as the cards were dealt out. Dividing themselves into two tables, Marcus, Tiv, Clara and Ashnar formed one group, while Meilin, Britt, Cybil and Willem formed the other. The tables were decided this way because it was well known that Tiv and Marcus had a running tally of who'd won more games of Arcane. Ashnar herself enjoying the more competitive play, and Clara feeling more comfortable at that table than the other.

Willem and Cybil each had no complaints about spending time with Brittney and Meilin. They arranged to sit next to each other. 

Despite owning the cards, Clara didn't have the strong strategic mind for Arcane: Rising, and so the cards she'd brought along had to be organised into decks by Meilin and Brittney. The two girls sorted and organised the cards quickly, swapping and trading until they were satisfied and talking about the relative strengths of each other's combos.

At one point, Willem looked over to Cybil, "I have no idea what's going on..." to which Cybil shook his head in silent agreement.

"I mean, I've seen it played once..." the firbolg put forward.

"Did you get the gist of it?" Willem asked. Cybil shook his head somberly.

When they were finished, Brittney stacked a thick pile of cards in front of Cybil, and Meilin in front of Willem. Brittney announcing, "You do realise that you have to win. Right?" a slight tilt to her head as her grin gave her a very devilish visage.

"Willem, you don't want me to see you lose... do you?" Meilin similarly snuggled up next to Willem, taking his left arm as her own and snuggling against his side.

Willem and Cybil exchanged nervous glances, and then looked at their competitive girlfriends (although, in Cybil's case, he was still unclear how Brittney considered him). "I think we're in trouble..." Willem said, sliding his deck towards himself.

"They do say women are a curse on the sea..." Cybil said nervously, though the tiefling at his side whipped her tail to smack his back painfully, making him flinch, "Ow!!"

They had decided for their first game to test the new decks by teaching Willem and Cybil to play. Arcane: Rising was a reasonably complex game. Neither of the boys had a hope of getting it on their first try. It was mostly a battle of wills between Meilin and Brittney.

"You capture territory by playing runes," Meilin started, "And you use runes to summon familiars, who in turn have special abilities. Weaving the right runes in order will also make special effects called 'spells', but only if you've got the spell in memory." she pointed to a particular card in Willem's hand. "Using your spells and familiars, you'll be able to capture the enemy wizard and win the duel."

"... uh huh...?" Willem's brow furrowed as he looked at the arcane writing on all of the cards. 

Meilin giggled, and fairly soon the game was started. Britt's deck, played by Cybil, was typically an offensive, rush style deck. Large explosions and fiery magic effects as Cybil's board was soon filled with ferocious creatures ready to cut Willem's health. Meilin's own deck had a more defensive style to it. Designed to survive forever and wittle Cybil (or Brittney) down over time and survive wave after wave of assault.

Playing through their proxies, the game between the girls was intense. The strategies they used were worlds apart when attacking and defending. All the while, as the excitement grew they were leaning over the game board to read the cards and try and get a handle on the right game state to win. 

"We go wide and hit with all four fiery mephits..." Britt reached over and turned the cards to indicate attackers. By this stage Cybil was just watching.

Meilin pointed at Willem's hand, "So now you can respond with this..." Willem looked at her and held the card up. Meilin indicated at the board with her finger, "Draw your runes..."

"Ahh... it says I need 'Gith' 'Zot'..?" Willem asked. Meilin nodded, and Willem turned the appropriate cards before placing his counterattack. "Um... as a reaction I cast Melf's Acid Arrow? And they all die?"

"No, no... two of them die..." Meilin pushed two of the mephits back over to Brittney, who took them off the field. "The rest you can use your golem."

"Oh okay, I use the golem!" Willem moved the golem to defend the mephits.

Brittney grinned, "And when the golem kills my mephits, they explode! dealing you four damage."

"What?! Why do they do that?" Willem frowned, looking at Meilin.

Meilin laughed, "It's what mephits do, Will. They go boom when you hit them."

At the end of the game, Brittney folded her arms and thre her head back in victory, like a cat that got the cream. Meilin smiled as she cleaned up the board. "We lost?" Willem asked.

"We won?" Cybil asked similarly.

Brittney slapped the large firbolg on the back heartily, "Couldn't have done it without you, Cybil!"

"I don't really feel like I did anything at all..." Cybil shook his large head.

Meilin put her hand out to shake Brittney's, and they shared a congratulations. Willem poured himself another flagon of rum and shared the bottle around the table. Already the girls were shuffling for another round.

They played through until the candles burned low, the sweet rolls and fruits were eaten, the rum was drunk and eyelids began to draw heavily downwards. One by one they turned in. A curtain was hung up between the men and women, as they changed to bedclothes and moved to turn in for the night.

It was the stroke of midnight that Marcus awoke. At first, turning his neck, he felt as if he were in a delirium. The swaying motion of the boat on the waves making his world swirl and swell. He didn't realise immediately what had roused his slumber, only that the noise of Willem's tipsy snoring was vibrating next to him. Tiv's periodic hissing and kicking just above his head in the top hammock.

"I need to piss..." he thought to himself. Carefully pushing out of his hammock, he steadied himself on the boat floor and swayed in the darkness. Groping around to find his boots, and making his way up to the deck.

Pushing open the hatch, he felt a fine mist of water wash over his face, as the rains light footsteps greeted his skin. The candle lanterns were flickering on top of the deck, providing just enough light to see. His ears pricked. A gentle harmony was sounding over the waves and creaking wood. Clara was up.

Clara stood at the bow of the ship. As far as she could get from her sleeping friends, and drew her bow slowly over her violin. The tune she played was soft and haunting, notes hanging in the air as she delitactely brought them in and out of existence. The sound of the waves roiling underneath her, and the wood's noisy creaking muffled her quiet song. 

Unlike her difficult repertoire, or the tavern songs she loved to fiddle out, she was playing something akin to a meandering poem. As if it wrote itself on her bow, her fingers dancing over the fingerboard. It was not difficult, and yet it wasn't simple. It didn't have a definite place or style, sounding draconian at first, and then taking elements of a Masacoll lullabye, and moving on to something that a pixie would sing. 

It rose with the water, and then petered to nothing as the ship fell. She didn't play from any music, the haunting vibrations seeming to resonate with the entire noisescape around her. Adding to it, weaving it and shaping it. The rain. The wood. The sea. The clomping sound of footsteps. The beating of her heart. The shimmering fae divination spell that was watching her. A sea of noises, a sea of melodies and harmonies, a sea of rhythms and a thrumming beat to the entirety of everything underneath it all.

"You're up late."

Clara squeaked the note and jumped out of her skin, whipping around and almost falling from the boat's rocking, "Oh Gods and devils! Marcus you scared me!"

Marcus smiled, standing steady and reaching slightly in case she fell. Clara drew in her shoulders, the already petite girl tucking her chin downwards and gripping the neck of her instrument for comfort. "What brings you up here?"

He shrugged, "I had to pee."

Clara nodded, looking nervously over her shoulder. "Oh..."

Marcus reached out a hand, and held Clara's shoulder tightly. "Look at me." Clara turned her head upwards to look at him. Marcus' kind but rough expression was creased with worry. The dark hair matting against his tan skin. Even in the glow of candlelight she could make out his features, dark eyes, and the strong frame that had grown now to tower over her. Marcus spoke seriously, "Why are you being weird?"

Clara tucked her chin down and tried to look away, but Marcus squeezed her shoulder to get her attention. "That trick doesn't work on me. You don't have any trouble talking when you want to. What's up?"

Clara sighed. pushing her hands together, and turning her body to move over to the ship's railing. "I'm just a little worried about everything, I guess..."

Marcus moved next to her, "Worried about what..?"

Clara gripped the railing, looking out into the pitch blackness. There was a yawning finality to the darkness, spreading on to forever. "Everything... the wardens... the sea elves... the captain... the... the dead people."

Marcus reached out to touch her back, "It'll be alright."

Clara shook her head and turned to him, "No. It won't." She looked directly into him. The striking blue eyes held firm. "None of this is 'alright' Marcus. None of it is okay."

Marcus held up his hands, "Look we're around friends, we--" but cut himself off when he saw Clara's face. The unspoken bond of almost a decade of friendship, he knew exactly when she wanted to speak without her saying.

Clara turned her violin over in her hand, and then held it out to him, which he took delicately. "This one was made by my grandfather..." she said softly, using a delicate finger to trace the outline of the violin's F hole. "He's the only person my great-grandfather taught to make violins. And you can see there..." she pointed out a small, imperceptible nick along the side of it. "He messed up. He was only sixteen-years-old when he made this." Marcus held the violin closer to his face, squinting to see the imperfection that Clara was pointing out, but to his eye it was impossible.

"My father played on this violin until he was thirty. He won some competitions with it. After that though, he thought it would be better for our brand for him to use his own. So now I have it," she said simply. Delicately taking the violin off him, she held the neck of it, and admired it, "Its' quality and history, it's probably worth about five platinum pieces..."

Marcus blinked in shock, "FUH-- five plat?!"

Plucking at the strings affectionately, she intoned a tiny E note as she said, "Marcus. Even with all this means to me, as expensive and irreplaceable as it is. Even for all the shame it would bring me, I would throw this thing in the ocean, and vow never to play again if it meant we didn't have to go on this stupid adventure."

Marcus blinked, shaking his head to clear his head and take the gunk out of his ears. Looking for the joke, he saw only Clara's downcast, serious expression. As the words sunk in, felt his fists ball, "What the hells do you mean?!" His voice raised. "Clara that's your pop's violin! You never even let anyone touch it!!"

She brought the instrument to her chist, wrapping her arms around it as if to ask it for forgiveness over what she'd just said. "It's... it's how I feel, Marcus... I hate this adventure. I hate all this fighting..."

Marcus put his hands on his hips, "What..? Well, why didn't you stay home?"

Clara shook her head, "I'm not going to let my friends put themselves in danger..." she looked up at him, "Even if all I can do is cheer you up with a song... I will."

Marcus considered his words, turning away to look at the darkness and search his feelings, "Well, you know... I've never felt better..." He thought about the friends he'd made at the barracks, the party at the Gylden's, meeting Veda and fighting against the terrible T Rex. "I mean we've met so many people! We've found out about so many things. The wardens. Magic. Nelly's laboratory. It's all... It's fun! It's exciting! It's--"

"Dangerous!!" Clara cut in. "It's dangerous, Marcus. I've watched people die. I saw Britt get attacked by Zombies. I saw Meilin take a javelin through the shoulder!"

"It's not," Marcus held her shoulders, "It's fine."

"It's NOT FINE!" Clara's voice broke as it cracked with her emotions. "I don't have magic. I'm not smart like Ashnar or Tiv. I'm not bold like Brittney or strong like you and Meilin. I'm just weak and cowardly and dumb."

"No," Marcus said steadily, "You're not. You're special-"

Clara scowled. A fierce expression unlike anything he'd ever seen before. A raw, raging emotion written on her features as she screamed, "I'm not special! You're not special either, Marcus! I'm just a spoiled little rich girl that plays violin, and you're a stupid little boy who lost his parents." Marcus almost stumbled backwards with what she said, "They're DEAD Marcus. There's no bringing them back. This isn't an adventure book, and you're not the pirate king! This is real, and if you don't wake up to that, you'll be dead too."

Marcus was dead silent as her words cut the air. Clara breathed heavily after her outburst, and steadied herself on the ship's railing next to her. The smell of brine was everpresent and thick in the air. Marcus stiff, his expression dark. 

Looking back on this time, there were few things in her young life that Clara could truly say that she regretted or things she didn't want to remember. Among those memories though, standing out as the most painful, would always be the look on Marcus' face when she'd twisted the proverbial knife in the orphan's stomach. The realisation of the gravity of her words slowly sank in, and the look on his face terrified her. In that moment she had no fear of him hitting her, in fact, the thought occurred to her that at least if he'd slap her she'd understand why. The silent look he gave her thought was cryptic and unknown. What she really feared in that moment was that the cut of her words was so deep that he'd turn and leave. That he'd never come back. 

"Marcus... I-" She started, but cut herself off. Just as he knew when she wanted to talk from their lifelong friendship, she in turn  knew that he wanted to as well.

Marcus' silence hung thick in the air for a few more moments before he spoke, "Don't apologise. Just tell me why you said it. Why you would EVER bring that up."

Clara swallowed hard, and looked away. In many ways it was harder to not apologise in that moment. It meant that the words would linger in her ears, reverberate in her skull for longer. She tasted bitterness on her tongue, from the bile in her stomach. "I want to throw up..."

Marcus nodded, "You can if you want..." and began to turn, but was stopped by her hand holding his arm.

"No..." She squeezed tightly, Looking up into his eyes, she could see the hurt and upset in his expression. Heaving a sigh, she cast her eyes down for a moment to gather her thoughts. "Marcus I..." She took a deep breath, "I was trying to hurt you. I was trying to open your eyes to make you listen."

"You succeeded. I'm listening." Marcus' voice remained completely measured.

Clara's voice wavered under his glower, and she felt every fibre of her being trembling. "I know what I said was terrible. It was completely unforgiveable and--" she cut herself off from apologising, "I'm scared. I'm terrified because I keep seeing all those dead people in my mind when I close my eyes. I keep seeing Meilin rushing into the burning building, or that look on that zombiething's face... or even that time at the beach when I thought you were going to get your head bitten off. I still have nightmares about watching you get eaten." She looked up to meet his gaze, "But you... you're... having fun! This is it, the adventure you've wanted for years. The chance to save the city, the sea elves, the story of your legacy..." her voice started to crack, "It's everything you've ever talked about since we were kids."

Marcus' expression was stony as she continued. Her voice cracking heavily as she started to break into tears that rolled off her cheeks. "But... this what you don't get..." she could barely talk through her sobbing, the hardness catching her throat. "You might have a lot of dreams... but I only have one Marcus."

As the boat rocked, Clara's body slumped into his. Cold and trembling, she gripped around his torso and buried her face, not wanting to look at him, and not able to stand on her own feet any more. He felt the weight of her body as she sobbed and trembled in his arms. The final thing she said ringing in his ears over and over again. Marcus had noticed over the last few months that ever since Clara had started talking about the feywild, her emotions had grown stronger. More fierce and harder to control.

The silence between them hung thick in the air as they stayed on the rocking bow. Thoughts whirled in his head as he held her gently. He sighed eventually and looked out into the darkness, before looking back down to her. "You know I don't feel that way about you..." he said quietly. He felt her nodding softly against his chest.

Eventually, she was able to pull herself away enough to look up at him. "I mean... I love all of my friends.... and all in the same way. I feel like this about Ashnar, Brittney, Meilin, even Tiv. I love all of you."

"You'd throw away your violin for all of them?" he asked quietly.

"Even if it was only one of them. Any one of them." She responded definitely. 

Marcus leant over, pulling her head against his chest, and softly kissing the crown of her head. "Well let's make sure you don't have to ever do that." Clara tucked her chin down to her chest, gripping the neck of her fingerboard tightly. "You're not allowed to stop playing music, okay? For as long as you live."

Clara nodded softly, pushing her body against his again to find comfort. "I'm sorry..." the words slipping out finally, as she felt her body finally calming down.

Marcus nodded, feeling his chest inflate with a deep breath, "I know." He breathed slowly, "I forgive you."
