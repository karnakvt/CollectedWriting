# The Girl With Pink Hair

A moment of silence was punctuated by the sounds of bated breathing and a small cough. Underneath the amber glow of candlelight and elevated slightly by a sole wooden platform, Clara stood in motionless tension. Her pink hair flowing in bows and troughs of angelhair down to her waistline, her usual garb had been replaced by her more flambouyant harlequin striped troubadour outfit. She was alone on that stage, the pressure of performance pushing down on her slender shoulders until she wanted to break. Her eyes sewn shut from nervousness, she projected herself out to the tavern audience that watched her in silence. How silly she must look. How she would mess up the notes. How awkwardly she stood. She desperately fought these feelings down as she raised with a trembling hand her violin to her chin and clenched her jaw. The din of the tavern that was previously a deafening roar of boisterous laughter and flirtations had silenced until a mouse would be too embarrassed to squeak.

She took a moment to touch the neck of the instrument softly. Feeling  lacquered wood smooth under her fingertips, the tones of the strings that slid along the grooves of her fingertips. As she brought her bow to touch the string, what erupted was a brilliant rainbow of music. As a surgeon's knife ruptures flesh, she ruptured the silence with her bow and what bled forth was a torrent of wondrous sound. The piece was an old one known as "The Allegro of Palladio". What began with a dark and relentless drumming burst in a brilliant allegro that rose and fell in a bright, thrumming arpeggio. She understood the piece well, and performed both as a virtuoso and a student. Allowing the simple sections to be simple, and then decorating the brightest rhythms with notes that sounded impossible. In sections of heightened tension she burst forth with a soft legato to soothe the upper notes, only to bring the tension back with a feverish pizzicati in the lower registers of her violin. It came to a head with a final relentlessly rondo tremolo, and a note to finish as a full stop as she thrust her bow away to her side and breathed out in a sigh of relief. Ears ringing and alive with the reverberation of the song

Voices lifted in elation as wooden mugs slammed against the stone and wood tabletops. Clara still didn't have the guts to open her eyes to look at everyone, but she was able to imagine their faces as she felt a smile creep across her lips. Counting to three, she opened her eyes to see what little she could of the audience and bowed graciously, "Thank you..." her soft voice was completely drowned. Requests started being yelled across the room as sailors, merchants and vagabonds all clamoured to hear the violinist fiddle their favourite songs.

After her solo performance, she was joined by the rest of the night's performers to play more regular music. Intermixing traditional dances, "The Old Orc's Dinna", two-step tunes, sailing songs like "Don't Take a Dwarf on a Salty Barge," and finally providing the backing music to the more stellar vocalists. She felt her heart lift with every tune. When the audience knew the piece and chanted along to the lyrics a big smile grew on her face. The songs were delightfully simple and melodious. The parts that she didn't know from heart she could pick up based on the chord progressions.

Three hours on the stage melted away with merriment and song. Notes and voices mingling with the smell of alcohol and well cooked meat. Finally, it was time for her to resume her regular duties of the night. Walking off with her arm weary from holding her violin, she beamed when she caught the face of her employer, the old gray firbolg Tedac Lowan. "Uncle Ted..!" she said over the din of music and joviality.

Ted turned his enormous head from the bar and smiled as Clara addressed him. "Pinky," he responded. Standing well over seven feet tall, he was large for even one of the fey half-giants. Clara tilted her head back as her breath caught up to her. "I think I'm getting closer! I think I could really feel the magic around me that time..."

Ted felt a chuckle erupt from his chest as he held his hand over his mouth. Preventing himself from laughing too hard. Nodding slowly, he said, "Put your apron back on and get your last hour of work in, we'll talk about it later." Nodding quickly Clara went on her way. It wasn't long before she joined with the raven haired tiefling girl Brittany. Another small prodigy and budding warden.

"And how are you going raising two young girls as proteges?" A man in a flambouyant yellow cloak sparked up to his left. Clara had been dizzy with the excitement of performance, and hadn't seen Captain Dalton Reed seated only two seats down from where she was standing. Nevertheless, her brief conversation with Tedac was overheard.

"I'm not raising them, they've got parents for that!" Ted scoffed jovially as he filled up another flagon for his patrons.

Leaning further against the bar, Reed smirked, "Well that can be worse, can't it? Raising a teenager is one thing, controlling them when they're away from their parents is another."

Despite laughing along with the joke Ted shook his head, "They're good girls each of them. I've known little firecracker since before she can remember, and Pinky's always keeping her nose clean."

"... and?" Captain Reed begged the question, an eyebrow cocked as he lifted his mug for a drink.

"...And what?" Ted snapped back.

Hunching forwards with his hand to his cheek, preventing scrying from other patrons, he spoke in a low, conspiratorial tone, "Are the young bards learning magic well from the famed Glamour Knight of Summer?"

Ted's expression dropped and started to sour as his brow furrowed and he heaved a sigh. Leaning forward to talk privately with Reed, the two men spoke with each other in hushed whispers. "Brittany is taking to it like a fish to water but..."

"... but what?"

"Well, you saw the performance tonight," he waved in the direction of the stage where Clara had been.

Reed blinked in surprise, "It was amazing! She filled up the whole room with noise and captured the audience entirely."

"Yes, you felt it?"

Reed sat in silence for a moment, thinking before responding, "There wasn't any magic..."

Tedac shook his head slowly, "Not quite. There was plenty of magic. Bardic magic relies on the conversation between two distinct entities. The audience and the performer. It pulls from the threads of experiences from each person in the audience, and when the threads are gathered they are woven by the expert performer's instrument to perform miracles of light and sound, living forever in the audience's mind. This is the cycle of musical magic, a lullabye shared from mother to child to child to child, living forever in the weave. This audience, the Siren's song, are an amazingly magical audience. We have people from all over the world sharing drink and song together in one moment. They know every word to the song, they sing and dance and beat their chests to sing about their lives at sea."

"... Then what's wrong?"

"What's wrong is the performer," looking over, Reed and Tedac's gazes were turned on Clara and Brittany as they bussed tables together. The naturally quiet introvert with pink hair and the brazen tiefling next to her couldn't be more worlds apart when they were serving customers. "It's not that she's incapable of wielding the magic... more..." he searched for words for a moment, "It's as if the weave itself avoids her. It has no way of channeling through her instrument, so instead it just dissipates through the room and gets amplified and reflected back in a haphazard way."

"You think it's the famed Steibelt violins?"

Tedac shook his head, "I've inspected it myself, that violin is an amazing bardic focus. Layered with stories and history. Etched with a thousand impressions from her endless practice and the fingerprints of her grandmother and great-great-grandfather. The spirits in the very woodgrains sing in harmony with her playing."

"So the performer... but her blood! She's feytouched, surely!"

Tedac nodded slowly, "Hair as pink as a nectar-rich flower." He paused for a second as his lips pursed, "Fey blood. Descended from a family of violinists. Played music her entire life.  An amazing, passionate personal talent. Practices until her fingers bleed. Fills rooms with sound and wild magic. Recites poems and stories for hours. All this and yet not a single magical circuit is open in her chest. Can't even channel the simplest cantrip."

Reed shook his head, "From what I know about magic, it doesn't add up. All of the elements are there."

"... indeed,"

After a moment of silence, and a few heady sips of his drink, Reed spoke again, "Well you remember what Ez used to say... Equations always add up in the end. If the numbers don't seem to add up it's because you don't know the whole story."

Tedac side-eyed the flambouyant captain. "What do you mean?"

Reed took another long swig of his drink before responding "We've been the Wardens of Masacoll for almost two decades. In that time we've seen cultists, pirates, smugglers and more than I care to remember. Given what we've seen over the years, is it really so hard to imagine there's something weird going on with a pink-haired girl that has ZERO magical aptitude?"

"Outside interference..?" Tedac suggested, for Reed to shrug in response.

The evening drew on. The rambunctious tavern's fever increased in pitch and the men made their passes at the dancing girls. Giving flirtations to the servers the sailors spent their coin freely. More than once Clara found herself at the receiving end of such interactions, only to quickly make herself scarce and hide behind her much more forward friend Brittany. The young men found it good sport to playfully torment young Clara and gauge her reactions, only to feel the intimidating glare of the tiefling moments later and tucking their tails between their legs.

"You're going to have to learn to talk for yourself one day, you know," Brittany spoke to Clara.

"I know... I just..." she searched for words, "I freeze up when they look at me, you know?"

"When they look at you..?" Brittany held up her crimson red, clawed hand, yellow cats-eyes narrowing, "You think I don't know what it's like to be looked at?" speaking with her infernal twin-voiced accent.

Clara stammered in response, "I-I'm sorry," and she closed her eyes for a moment to think about what she wanted to say, "You're... you're just so good at handling it... I admire that about you."

Brittany sighed and rolled her eyes, "Whatever--" to which Clara smiled in response. Brittany's prickly nature covering a deeper friendship between them. "... you know where to find me," the tiefling said finally as she walked off to continue her work.

Finally, it was time for Clara to go home. In the dressing room she changed into her street clothes. Her shoulders and back aching from work as she pulled on her breeches and tunic. Releasing her hair ties she teased the pink mess with her fingers and tossed her head to set it properly. Sighing as she stared at herself in the mirror.

"You didn't feel the magic at all, did you Clara?" The mirror image spoke to her, as if talking into her soul. The image embossed in silver looked exactly like her, and the way the blue eyes stared deeply into her soul was disquieting. Bringing up a comb, she started to tease the knots in her hair left from the tie.

"I'm not talking to you... you're not real," Clara said simply in response. Looking back towards the reflection with a small amount of disdain.

The reflection smirked, "Real or not, it doesn't change the fact that you can't hear your own music."

"I CAN hear it!" Clara shot back.

"Liar." The reflection's expression soured, as Clara angrily shook her head to blink out her tears, "A liar and a crybaby. What a pitiful excuse for a creature."

"I'm not a liar! I can hear it!" She cried out, louder than she likely intended.

The reflection's vicious mockery continued. "You can't. You and I both know that you can't. You can't hear your music, you can't learn bardic magic, you can't help your friends and you're a burden on Brittany. Admit it. You couldn't even save that woman. You'll be a failure as a warden! Admit it!"

"No!"

The mirror's image twisted and distorted before Clara's eyes, to show her the expression of the dying woman's face just as the light faded from her eyes. Tearfully, Clara balled her fist and mashed it towards the glass, "No!!" beating the image over and over again until the glass cracked. Looking at the shards of the broken mirror, Clara's voice bubbled out of her chest, "I can hear it... I can hear it..." sucking balls of air into her lungs in bursts and gasps as she cried softly, regaining her composure slowly.

Leaving the room, she pulled her sleeve up over the warden's mark on her milk-white shoulder. Rubbing her fist where it smarted from hitting the mirror and trying to reorder the swirling thoughts of her mind, to make them make sense.

"I'll ask you again, Pinky," Tedac's voice startled her as she whipped around to see him leaning against the side of the wall, smoking his pipe, "Who's that in your ear, when you're all alone?"

Clara's mouth moved to speak, unable to look Tedac in the eye, and unable to lie at the same time to her uncle. She chose instead to stay silent until she was dismissed, hoping that the questions wouldn't get too awkward in this interrogation.

Reaching down, the giant firbolg took the small girl's hand in his own. Looking at her hand in his giant paw, she thought it looked something like a doll's hand. Too late did she realise that he was looking at the bruising around her knuckles. "Now you can't tell me it's nothing..." Tedac said sombrely. "I can fix the mirror easily enough, but if you don't want your grandma seeing what you've done to your bow hand you'll come clean with me."

Biting her lower lip, Clara shook her head one more time. For whatever thoughts swirled in the young girl's heart, there was nothing that would make her admit her phantasms out loud, not even the disappointed look in her beloved grandmother's eyes.

Heaving a sigh, Tedac entered the dressing room, "What am I going to do with you..." he asked rhetorically. Approaching the broken glass of the mirror, he pulled a small tuning flute from his lapel and blew it quickly to find an anchor note. Waving his hand in mystic circles as he hummed a tune that seemed to resonate with the fabric of the universe itself. Weaving a beautiful rune using his finger and his voice, he thrust the glowing energy towards the mirror and completed the spell, "... Mending," he said under his voice. The mirror's broken shards reforming and fusing with itself until the mirror was repaired.

"Now I guess it's time for..." Tedac's sentence was cut short, causing Clara to look up at him with wide eyes. To her amazement, Tedac's eyes were closed and his head thrown back. He was caught fast asleep in mid sentence, a deep growling snore erupting from his throat. Whipping her head around as the door of the dressing room slammed shut and the lights were dimmed. The room was now illuminated by an ethereal blue light from the mirror.

A lump of fear formed in Clara's throat as she gazed in wonderment at the shimmering glass. The reflective surface showing a reflection of the room she was standing in, except more fantastic, more glamorous. Nevertheless, she was enticed forward by the mirror's beauty, and the strangely familiar brown-haired girl staring back at her.

Subconsciously, Clara took a tuft of her bright rose hair and held it in her fist, looking at it as it hung from her head and then looking at her reflection. "My hair..." she caught herself whispering. "Why are you showing it to me brown?" The chestnut brown locks fell in neat yet lazy tumbles. The girl in the mirror looked so normal, so plain. A girl that nobody would think twice about looking at. A normal girl who could just fade into the background and not be seen. Contrasted with the bright beacon pink that she held in her fist.

"So many times I've dreamed of having normal hair..." she mumbled to herself, "Just being a normal Steibelt. A girl who just plays the violin with her papa and grandma. Who wasn't an awkward twit that couldn't talk to people properly!" She heaved a breath, "Why would you show this to me?!" Her voice was more demanding.

"Because a girl ought to have a choice! Don't you think, young Clara?" A thrumming woman's voice spoke from behind her. It was a joyous voice that seemed to summon morning larks and birdsong as it intoned. Every syllable a wry chorus that resonated in her bones. Clara whipped around to see the speaker, but as she turned in a circle she found herself staring at a mirror with the image of an impossibly beautiful woman, no, eladrin staring at her. With branches that seemed to grow for her hair and flowers all over her skin, as she spoke, fairies and brownies flitted about behind her. In the air around them, a resonating, resounding music that filled her soul with complete joy.

Clara was stunned by the visage. At the same time she was at ease and on edge. Silent questions at the tip of her tongue as her eyes danced around the image to try and drink in all of the colours and wonders she was gazing at.

Hearing the unspoken questions, the image spoke. "I am Titania, Queen of Summer and Liege of the Seelie Court. Wife of Oberan the Green and overlord of the Summer Fae."

"Mm... mm..." Clara's voice started to come out, "Eshnar-adul, Olbrek Titania."

The image burst forth with soft, motherly laughter as a chorus of Fae seemed to find amusement at the mumbling girl. "Forgive our reaction, the accent you use is most charming dear. Your studies in elvish are certainly being rewarded. It is nice to meet you too,"

Titania took a moment of silence for Clara to collect her thoughts, before continuing, "I apologise for not being able to meet you in person, but there are many matters and minutiae that require my immediate attention, and I couldn't pull myself away from my duties."

"Why do you people keep talking with me?" Clara burst out, before realising herself and covering her mouth with both of her hands.

Titania smiled and chuckled from the outburst, "Don't worry child, I am not pompous like your human Midgard nobles. We fae appreciate genuine outbursts of emotion. And you have a lot of emotion bottled up inside of you," she took a moment before answering, "Your spirit to us shines like a brilliant light in the darkness of night. What you call 'the feytouched' in the mortal realm appears to us like a bright gemstone with infinite facets. Naturally we are attracted to your aura as we see it, and mostly we just want to play. My subjects are a playful and capricious lot. Though we may find amusement in the occaisional prank or two."

"Why me..?"

"Why not?" Titania shot back with a girlish giggle. "Unlike Midgardians we don't try to control or explain the universe... simply to enjoy it." Clara's heart started to fall as she looked at the visage of Titania. Before she could speak, Titania continued. "That being said, it was brought to my attention with recent events that you may be seeing our company as a curse rather than a gift. We are not malevolent creatures. Seeing you tormented by your heritage brings us no joy."

Clara's brow furrowed as she listened, "So what are you saying, exactly?"

Titania's smile widened, "In short, owing to my position as queen of the Fae, I have the ability to remove the fae magic from your blood and make your hair brown again... as well as a few other minor alterations." As she said this, from the aether an image formed of Clara's face to Titania's left. From the swirling smoke, a plain, brown haired reflection of Clara smiled at her. She was pretty, with kind eyes that radiated warmth. Fully and completely human without a trace of magical alteration. "I would be extracting all of the fae-magic that thrums in your blood and you would be left as a normal, fourteen-year-old girl of Gylden. By this time tomorrow you would know nothing of voices in the night, imaginary friends or songs in the air."

"However, as a normal girl you would be unable to channel any magic without intense study. The journeys of sorcery and bardic magic would be closed to you and you would live the rest of your life without your innate gifts. Your music will no longer be able to channel the emotions of your audience, and while you will still be an accomplished musician, you will never be able to recreate the performances you can do now. Moreover, as a normal girl you will be ill-equipped to help your friends in their upcoming trials, and will be better off shutting yourself in your room to hide from them."

To the right, Clara saw the image of a more vibrant reflection of herself. It was Clara, pink hair and all, but with a broad grin on her face, hand thrust out with a sparkling ray of light at her fingertips. "Alternatively, you can sign a pact with me, and embrace who you are today with my magic flowing freely in your veins. Rather than snuff it out, I could unleash the floodgates of your potential and you would stand out more than ever, shining like a bright beacon of light in the faewild night sky."

"With this you would become my warlock. With the powers I offer to you, you would be able to help your friends, protect your island, and play your music without restraint. However you will be forever known as a strange girl. The fae-folk will naturally draw themselves to you and play whatever whimsical tricks they do. A quiet life of study and living with your family will be closed to you, as your adventures will forever draw you away from them."

Clara looked at Titania and asked, "... and... will I be able to hear it again..?"

"Your music? Yes of course," Titania reveled giddily. "Can't you hear it now?" As Titania quietened Clara's ears pricked at the sounds that were assaulting her. Indeed, ever since the faerie queen had summoned her visage Clara could hear a wonderous, rapturous song that seemed to permeate and vibrate on the very air itself, as if it was describing the very essence of springtime.

"Take my pact, Clara, and become my warlock of Summer. Let my power flow through you and let joyous laughter erupt from your chest."  Clara looked between the two images to her left and right. The brown haired girl smiled at her softly. So many nights Clara recalled trying to pull her own hair out by the fist. Thinking back to the stares that she got wherever she went. The look of disappointment that sometimes fell over her father's face. The whispers of infidelity that even reached her young ears.

The life without music was enticing to her. She couldn't hear her own violin anyway so there would be no loss. She would have friends in that world, a family, a place to be just normal. On the other hand, she thought about her current friends, the wardens, the woman reaching out to her with the light fading from her eyes. There was immense pressure ahead of her. Everyone would be looking at her and expecting to perform. Stages that were far more pressured and horrifying than the one she played on tonight.

She thought of Marcus, Meilin, Tiv, Brittany and Ashnar. She held their faces in her mind. She wanted to help them, to not be a burden. She had to protect the island from whatever killed that woman. If she was just a bit more powerful she could be useful. If she was a bit stronger she could help out more, not just be an awkward, stumbling fool.

As the question hung in tense silence, Titania's smile never faltered, watching the young girl's cogs turn over in her mind. "Are you ready... my child?"

Clara's gaze rose, as she looked the Queen of summer in the eye and responded, "Yes." Sucking in a breath to say, "I will become a warlock of the fae."
