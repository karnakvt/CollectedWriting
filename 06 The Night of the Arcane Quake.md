# The Night of the Arcane Quake

Ever since she'd alighted in the magical coral city of the Sea Elves, Lelenaes Aiqua, Clara noticed that there was an almost constant sheen of water on her skin. Absently, she drew her fingers across her arm to flick some of the droplets from her flesh, only for the moisture of the air to reassert itself on her. Unlike Gylden, or Masacoll proper, she'd noticed that she wasn't uncomfortably hot from the tropical climate and her body wasn't sweating to try and cool down. Down under the sea, the vast ocean all around them protected them from the heat and reflected down a cool, dappled light that was easy on the skin and cool to the touch. Everything smelled like salt, however, and she'd always felt like droplets were clinging to her as if she'd just gone for a swim. It was likely why the elven clothing was so light and breathable. Anything made from cotton or wool would be sodden and heavy within moments. Another curiosity was that unlike the surface, she didn't need to apply balms or lotions to herself to protect her skin from the weather.

Britt, Tiv, Meilin and Clara were just outside Serdan's residence at the dead of night. One of the four high Elven councillors, the paladin Serdan had harsh, angular features and a never smiling mouth that always seemed twisted in a perturbed expression. Luckily, due to the hour, he was well asleep. Ashna, for her own reasons had elected to be inside her stasis ball and couldn't leave, and Marcus had decided to sleep through the evening. The wardens had just returned from their adventure to the elven fighting pits, joined by the tiefling watcher, Ron. In order to earn some local coin and buy a sword, Meilin had wanted to pit herself against the local fighters of the region in an underground cage fight, and most of the wardens joined her to show support and watch the spectacle. Despite the ferocity of those she fought, she successfully dispatched her opponents in two desperate brawls. The first a hulking, barbaric man whose rage seemed to endlessly fuel his fighting spirit, and the second a lithe and agile martial artist, whose skills seemed evenly pitted at first against Meilin.

"I don't know how to put this..." Clara flinched after she spoke, a natural reaction when people looked towards her. Brittney, Meilin, Ron and Tiv all looked at her expectantly, and she felt the pressure on her neck. Clara cleared her throat and continued, "I don't know how to put this, without sounding like a horrible friend," she looked towards Meilin, "But when did you get so strong, Meilin??"

"What the hell do you mean?" Britt laughed incredulously, raising her voice and her yellow eyes narrowing. She checked herself with a sigh before she made fun, knowing that she had to be gentle with her softly spoken friend.

Clara ducked her head, then looking back up to the group, "I guess I just..." darting her eyes away, "I was thinking, as we ate, about the old days again. When we used to share those bread buns from Ma Baker in Tiv's toyshop. The Meilin from back then was so small and cute. I never would have imagined I would see her flipping over barbarians and shooting fire out of her hands..."

"I was serious about fighting back then too, Clara," Meilin said with a laugh, "I'm pretty sure I did my first hundred man kantai at the age of eleven," 

"But it's just so amazing what you can do now!" Clara said, awkwardly fiddling with her hands. "And I never saw you fight like that against Fellius and the gang," referencing a group of older teen bullies that used to terrorise Gylden's docks.

Meilin shrugged, "Well Marcus would usually stick his nose in before I had to get serious... and my dad would have my head if I went all-out on some dumb kids."

Brittney spoke, "I haven't thought about Fellius in years, whatever happened to that kid?"

"Marcus broke his nose," Meilin said as a matter of fact. "After that he stopped being a little shit and kept to himself in the smithy."

Brittney's brow furrowed, "I thought Marcus said he only stepped in to stop that fight..?" 

Meilin laughed, "How do you think he did that?"

All of the children laughed from the memories. Saying goodbye to Ron the Tiefling watcher at Serdan's gate, they made their way inside the property. It was a manse about twice the size of Clara's house. The building materials were some combination of sandstone, decorated by beautiful rainbow seashells. The texture just begging to be touched. Walking past the grand entrance, they moved quietly upstairs to the guest quarters. As they crept through the coral hallway, their eyes were averted to the ornate tapestries that lined the walls, telling old elven tales in their fabrics. As they arrived at the guest wing of the house and quietly looked to each other to say goodnight.

"BWWWWAAAAAAAAAA--" Gimble's ear-splitting alarm suddenly resonated hard before the mechanical canine suddenly slumped and became inert, the red core of it dimming to almost nothing. 

The feeling was like a needle to the brain. A sharp tug, as if the brain was being yanked out of the skull by a tether attached to the back of one's neck. A head exploding with agony followed by a ripple that swam down the river of the spine to churn the guts as the body tried to explode from the inside and spread the contents of the stomach all over the walls. It was nauseating and painful, so debilitating that it prevented one from screaming, because the mouth and oesophagus were instantly dried, all of the oxygen of the lungs immediately sucked out and the airway blocked. A suffocating, drowning agony that lasted about 20 beathless seconds at its apex.

It was an arcana quake. The second once-in-a-lifetime event that had happened only four weeks after the first.

Clara was doubled over immediately. Britt for her part shook in agony as she eventually found her breath to scream, and Tiv ground his jaw shut as he shuddered in pain. The entire house shook, as the arcana quake rippled through the sea-elf city, and the great rumbling sensation gave Meilin pause as she looked around, wide-eyed in shock.

Suddenly awake, Marcus flew out of his room with a slam and yelled, "Is everyone all right?" He was wearing pants from being scolded earlier.

Meilin whipped around to address him, "Ashna??"

Marcus pointed to her room, "You go, I'll pick up these three,"

Meilin darted immediately to Ashna's room, leaving Marcus with the three wardens. By this time, Britt had slumped against the wall, her elbows lifted high as she held her skull, Clara was a ball, trying to keep her insides on the inside and Tiv was cradling his skull, grimacing. Marcus turned to Britt first, being the closest, and gently placed his hands on her ribcage, "Britt, Britt. Breathe... Just breathe."

Brittney gasped as she found the air, and slowly opened her eyes to see Marcus' face. "Ohhh fuck, hoooooly shit," feeling every fibre of her body tremble, "Ohh goddamn, that hurts."

"What's going on?" Marcus said urgently, "Can you move? What's happening?"

Britt clenched her eyes shut. "Nnngh..." gritting her teeth as she spoke, "... arcana quake..."

"That's the thing that happened on the boat, right?" Marcus asked, Britt nodded softly in response. Marcus looked down to Tiv and Clara.

"Help Clara," Britt whispered, "... she's... more attuned to feywild."

Marcus knelt down to Clara's level. Meilin returning shortly after to announce, "Ashna's in the stasis bubble. I signed to her, she's fine. She doesn't feel anything."

"I wonder if she saw this coming..." Marcus said under his breath, unable to hide a small amount of annoyance. If she'd seen it coming, why didn't she say anything? The thought angrily swirled in his mind, but he shook his head to dismiss it as just a thought. As Meilin moved to pick up Tiv and cradle him, Marcus gently held the trembling girl in front of him.

Clara flinched from the touch, looking bleary eyed through her tear-soaked eyelids, she saw Marcus and felt a wave of relief coming over her body. Lost for words as usual, she felt a trembling, mewling sentence come out of her, "... it hurts..." she whined. 

"You'll be okay Clara, it'll pass," Marcus shuffled closer to her and put his arms around her warmly. "Just like it did last time, it won't be long..." The sentiment uttered more from hope than any true knowledge

The waves of brimstone-tasting, primordial and abyssal energy washed over the three magic users. Aftershocks of the quake hitting softer and softer. The entire household was now awake, with the magically attuned elves either writhing in agony or being attended to by those who were more physically inclined.

"We need to figure this stuff out, quickly," Marcus said, looking around.

"The elves probably need our help..." Meilin put in as a maid rushed past them.

There was a low, hissing grumbling coming from the smallest of them, as the small kobold Tiv was fussing and hitting the side of his mechanical dog with a small grunt, "Elvesss smelllvesss," he grumbled under his breath. "They can help themselvesss," he said.

Marcus' brow furrowed, looking down at the kobold tinkering away, "What's gotten into you, Tiv?"

"Well they are in a lot of pain," Meilin put in quickly.

Tiv shook his head, looking away from Gimble and asserting, "No pain! No pain, just thoughtsss," Tiv took some time to quietly tinker, only half aware that the wardens were watching him work. Casting a glance over his shoulder, "Why you all look at me?" 

Brittney moved over and squatted near the working kobold, "It's not like you to be so aggressive all of a sudden."

Tiv asserted with a hushed whisper, "We in enemy territory." He glanced up at the other wardens, "What differencsse between jungles with monsters and city with elvess? Nothing. Danger everywhere."

Brittney's brow furrowed, "But the elves took us in... gave us food and supplies,"

"And helped uncle Reytarn," Meilin put forward.

Tiv took a few moments to look between his friends, and hurriedly gestured for them all to be closer, so that they could communicate in whispers. As they all gathered around, Tiv said, "Elves do everything and they look like they friendsss. But they also take away fire. They take away Tiv weapons." His beady lizard eye flicking from Marcus to Meilin. "I know you trust. But the only people Tiv trust is people who can hear him right now. You. We kobolds small. Everything eat us. Dinosaur eat us, dragon eat us, goblin eat us, human eat us."

"What have the elves done, though, to make you suspect them?" Britt probed.

Tiv grumbled softly, giving Gimble one final THWACK behind the head, before the mechanical hound started bleeping, grinding and coming back to life. "The follow us, they tesst us, they look us funny on street. I see half of the elvess hatess us, the other half don't want anything to do with uss. We're lucky that the council didn't sentence us to death immediately after Clara talking to them."

Clara shuffled and gulped, but Brittney spoke before her, "Well that's because our little Clara has a way with words. She did amazing tonight!"

Tiv looked up at her, "Yes yes of course she did, look!" he held up his hand, "I'm still alive! Is amazing! All I'm saying is, when we need pretty words, Clara is best. When we need explosion? That's Tiv turn! But I can't do this because stupid no fire rule!!"

Brittney sighed, "We just have to put up with it until they trust us..."

"And when that?" Tiv snapped, "after we show them warden mark? After we pass stupid trial? After we kill Goldbleed? What we have to do for trust? What do they do so that we trust them??"

After a while, Marcus looked down at his hand, which was subconsciously gripping his father's coin, "Trust is built off favours, same as on the street. We do good things for them? They'll learn we're the right kinda guys."

Tiv took a sharp breath to retort, but then looked between his friends and closed his eyes. "Kobolds do traps," he said, thoughtfully, "We small, so we have to use traps to win." He looked between them again, "My nose sssmells traps here. I don't likess it."

Meilin knelt down to Tiv's level, with her hands on her knees. "Tiv... are you saying we're in danger?"

Tiv nodded quietly, addressing her directly, "Trials not be fair... we mussst be careful." He looked between each of them, "Take all precautionsss. Hide weaponss. Cheat. They will give us puzzles with no sssolutions and roles with no ansswers. Don't let them sssee your limits. If you think you can't passs: don't."

Marcus shifted, "I'm going to pass..." he said quietly. "There's no way I'll fail now." Thinking back on the look on his father's face. 

"There's EVERY CHANCE you'll fail, boy." A deep male voice intoned from further down the hallway. Making the children jump out of their huddle and turn around, they saw the scowling face of the tall, weary Elven Councillor, Serdan.

Clara stood tall and turned about to face him, "E-eshnar Agul, Child of the Sea"

"Eshnar Agul," Serdan responded politely. "You children need rest," moving forwards, he put his hand on Marcus' shoulder, "Especially you, boy. I'll not have any of you blaming the results of the trial on a sleepless night."

Brittney scowled suddenly, "Hey! How come you don't look like you just got hit by a truck just now... aren't you a magic user?!"

Serdan found himself chuckling, turning to the tiefling, "Young lady, I swore an Oath of Devotion to my Goddess Selune. Every day I stand tall with my chest proudly bared for my people to feel protected, and my enemies to wake in their pathetic terror." He lifted his hand and made a chopping motion to his shoulder, "If you were to cleave my body in two, I wouldn't flinch. I'd be far, FAR too insulted." He looked between all of them, "Now scurry off to your rooms, 'wardens'. My household has the immediate crisis in hand."

With that, Serdan stomped through the group to move on with the immediate crisis. 

The wardens exchanged hugs and began heading off to their separate rooms. Just as she was about to reach out her hand to take the doorknob, Clara jumped out of her skin as a red, scaled and yet deceptively soft hand engulfed hers. As Clara turned around, Britt held a finger to her lips.

"Shh," Brittney cut her off, whispering back. Taking no time at all, Britt rushed Clara into her room, and closed the door behind her, trapping the little warlock between her door and her rather aggressively inquisitive friend, "Before you say anything else girl. Why ARE you wearing that dress tonight?" 

Clara's eyes flew wide. "Um?!" darting her eyes left and right. The other wardens didn't overhear, saying goodnight and moving off, "Well we were going out so..."

Britt cut her off with just the look on her face. "You're not dressed to go to a fighting pit, Clara. You're dressed to go on a date."

Clara's heat rushed to her face, blushing so hard under interrogation that it triggered her natural rosacea and crossing over her nose and earlobes. "Wh-whatever do you mean?" a nervous laughter bubbling out of her throat.

Britt smirked and flicked some fluff off her shoulder, brushing it affectionately. "You don't have to lie to me, Clara, I'm not your bitch governess. Who, by the way, would have an absolute conniption seeing your tits out in this dress."

Clara's harsh whisper shot through her teeth as she covered her chest, "My tits aren't..."

Brittney giggled as her tail flicked and whipped mischievously. "Well they're not exactly tucked in like in your usual hoity-toity 'I must see the Favershams for tea' dress either, darling." Clara clamped her mouth shut, speechless, and looked to the side. Knowing that she'd been caught. Brittney rubbed her shoulder again, and then moved to hug her, "Clara... you know I worry about you."

"I know... thank you." She whispered back.

Britt side-eyed her, and Clara felt the intensity of her yellow devil orbs boring into her, "So, are you going to tell me who it is?"

Clara checked to make sure they were alone in her own room, before quietly insisting, "I get one secret."

"You still read Paddinson Bear books," Britt said firmly and dismissively.

Clara pursed her lips, "I get another one!"

Britt's facial expression fell slightly, "Clara, I don't like secrets between us. You shouldn't have to keep things from me,"

Clara nodded abashedly and looked at the floor between them, "I'm sorry... I just know this is going to make you a little mad..." she paused for a second to ready herself, "I wanted to summon Yarlin, to thank him for the flowers from a few days ago."

"YARLIN?!" Britt yelled, and immediately covered her own mouth. Whispering conspiratorially, "Are you insane?? What's gotten into you Clara??"

Clara held her friends shoulders softly, "I'm sorry, I didn't umm... I don't..."

Brittney spoke very slowly, calming down her own rushing thoughts "Clara. Just take a second and think. This is serious! Yarlin's dangerous Clara. He's not a good guy, he's a devil." After she said it, Britt felt a twist inside of herself as the old prejudice against devils had been used against herself many times.

"He's powerful." Clara said, insistantly. Bunching up the fabric of her dress in her fists, she stared directly into Britt's eyes. "He's powerful, he can't hurt me, and he's... interested..."

"What? What are you saying..." Britt's nose twisted, trying and failing to hide her disgust.

"Britt..." Clara said quietly, "Yarlin might be able to help us with that Goldbleed creature. I just want to... talk to him... myself. About options, perhaps."

"... dressed like that." Brittney's nose turned up.

"Ohhhh yes!" A deep, thrumming male voice resonated from Clara's bed, the sharp tang of brimstone in the air as the towering devil toyed with a small, pink flower that he was delicately fondling. "Clara my dear you do look like quite the peach tonight indeed." Yarlin's voice resonated with a strange, infernal bass that seemed to make the heart beat faster. He had manifested his existence wearing little more than sheets. An outfit that was revealing even by sea-elf standards. It left little to the imagination for the 8-foot tall devil's chiseled physique.

"Y- Yarlin?!" Brittney scowled. "What in the hells are you doing here?

Yarlin laughed, "Well don't ask me, you were both going 'Yarlin' this and 'Yarlin' that, so TA-DAAA here I am!" With that, he confidently cocked his knee in the air, drawing the flower across his skin.

"Well you can go back to where you came from because..." Brittney trailed off when she felt Clara's hand on her elbow.

Clara stepped forwards. The subtle trembling of her hand could be felt through her grip on Brittney's elbow. "Thank you... thank you for joining us, Captain Yarlin. I do hope your trip was... pleasant?"

Yarlin reclined lazily, propping his head up with his hand and looking directly into young Clara's eyes, the thick, dark brows coming to a furrow, infinite yellow orbs glowing subtly with otherworldly power, "Oh darling, don't be so stiff, I'm already in your bed... and I'm supposed to be the stiff one here."

Britt sucked in air, "HOW D-" but cut herself short when she heard a soft sound.

Clara was giggling. A small blush on her cheeks as she stepped forward, "If you think you're going to impress me with dirty jokes, dear captain, you'll have to try harder."

Yarlin grinned, "How hard do you like it?"

Clara laughed softly, "I guess that depends on my appetite at the time."

Yarlin sat forward, "And what's your appetite at the moment?"

Clara's eyes fluttered as she broke eye contact with him, her cheeks growing rosy. The question hung in the air as Clara moved to her dresser and lifted a small object from the shelf. "Be that as it may, dear captain. I did call you here for a purpose, not just to talk about yours or my appetite."

Britt quietly whispered, "Clara..." under her breath.

Yarlin moved to the side of the bed, and then rose to his full stature. The way the small sheets fell from his body, there was nothing left to the imagination of Yarlin's body. The sheets designed to accentuate every aspect of the male figure, the angles of the shoulders, the size of his chest, his musculature, and of course what was between his legs was only technically covered. "You are truly cruel to talk of such things and then move to business, Clara. I presume you have a question for me?" 

Clara laughed and approached him, gently lifting his large palm and holding a small object in the center that he couldn't see for her delicate knuckles, "I understand you wish to court me, captain?"

Yarlin looked between the two. The turning of events were a surprise even to him. "I... wouldn't use the word 'court' to describe all the things I want to do to you... but yes."

Clara opened her hand and allowed him to admire the small gift. It was a small, jeweled bracelet, made from tiny, shining seashells. "Then, allow me to return a gift to you, dear captain," she curtsied shortly after, "Madam Hardgreaves always said that if a lady is courting a gentleman, when she receives a gift she ought to return either her affections or a gift so that he doesn't feel slighted,"

Yarlin turned the bracelet over, and slipped it coolly over his hand. "Well well... I wasn't expecting this..." looking back up to her, "Does this mean I won't be enjoying your affections tonight, Clara?"

Clara giggled, "Perhaps another time,"

Yarlin smiled and reached out to touch her cheek, the warm, rough digits scraping against her jaw softly, "A shame. Oh I have about a thousand ways I'd enjoy plucking you, little peach." 

Clara stepped back out of his reach and smiled politely, "Well for the time being you shall have to sate yourself with your imagination... and your hands,"

Yarlin's head tilted as his ears perked. Britt yelling, "Clara?!"

"I'm well aware of how boys... I'm well aware of what they do at night and how they do it." Clara shot back, "I'm not a fool."

Yarlin laughed, crossing his arms across his chest. "Well then, it seems I have a long night ahead of me. Is there anything else I can do for you, Lady Steibelt? A question perhaps?"

Clara smiled and softly shook her head, "The old tales say that our imaginations serve us as an eternal, private paradise." Lifting her hand to her lips, she blew a kiss to him, "I hope you enjoy yours, captain."

Yarlin harumphed, saying "Tease," under his breath and clicking his fingers loudly to disappear in a puff of acrid smoke. 

Clara giggled softly and turned to Brittney, before giggling again, "I don't think he's very happy with me,"

Brittney flinched, shaking her head momentarily before looking to Clara again, "Clara, what's gotten into you? he's a devil..."

Clara approached her friend slowly, before reaching out to embrace her softly, feeling Britt's warm body against hers, and the tight squeeze of the hug. "Brittney, isn't it a warlock's job to cavort with devils..?" Pulling back from the hug, Clara took both of Britt's hands in hers, looking into her eyes, "I'm not like you, I don't have magic of my own..."

Brittney felt herself frown, "You already have Titania..."

Clara's laugh was sudden and spontaneous, "You trust the fey?" Glancing off to the side, "They're really not much better if we're talking about safety, you know."

Brittney squeezed Clara's hands before dropping them. "I still don't like it..."

Clara held her hands in front of her, "I know..." holding up her hand, she held Britt's shoulder softly, "I would do anything to protect you, Brittney... and you would do anything to protect me," she smiled softly, "You fight with music... I fight with relationships and contracts," shaking her head as she said, "Your music is so wonderful and pure, I'd do anything to protect it."

Brittly scoffed, "Speak for yourself,"

The moment was shared in silence as the girls embraced one last time. Before she left, Brittney turned to ask one last question, "What's your plan if the devil betrays you?"

Clara giggled, "Oh, I'll just turn him into a skull and dump him somewhere... No big deal."
