# 2 Months Later

Clara sat at the breakfast table quietly, hands folded in her lap as she listened to the quiet at the table. Her governness, the stern-faced Madam Hardgreaves stared daggers at her, black eyes just waiting for the smallest crack in Clara's manners to jump down her throat and admonish her behaviour. Her father and mother weren't speaking. She had barely seen them since the terrorist attack. All she knew were the tense arguments that she'd half heard throughout the halls. The only one quietly humming to herself was Clara's grandmother Margaret.

It was her father who broke the silence, "Bread today..." he said simply.

"Oh stop it!!" her mother responded.

Clara waited silently, looking at her plate. The singular piece of bread on the plate almost mocking the fine china around it. The Steibelt family was not poor, of course, but at present there seemed to be much less than there used to be. "I'm allowed to be hungry! Am I allowed to be hungry?!" Her father said crossly.

"You just never stop! It's like you don't even care!!" Clara's mother shot back. After a small pause, she jabbed again, "You sound spoiled."

"I'm spoiled?! I'm SPOILED?" His voice was raised, and Clara could tell that his ears were closed. Nothing anybody said at this point would be able to calm his emotions.

"William Steibelt what sort of example are you setting?" Nonna Margaret started up.

Clara pushed down the hungry feeling in her stomach, the slight twist inside her organs swallowing down as she thought that perhaps she could will away the pain by eating her own hunger. Her eyes never moved from the piece of bread as she listened. She knew that the next part of this breakfast conversation would be using her as a pawn to win the argument. Her eyes flickering up to Ms. Hardgreaves, she looked back into the stern faced, perfectly made up visage of the hawkwoman. According to proper manners, neither woman nor girl could eat their bread until the head of the table had lifted his fork, and Clara's father was much too busy yelling at the rest of their family to eat.

"Forgive me for trying to put food on my daughter's plate!!" her father yelled.

Her mother leaned forward, "We had to give it up Will--"

"Three-HUNDRED platinum?!" There was a loud slam as her father balled his fists and smashed the table, "You HAD to give up three-hundred platinum?!"

She was shaking her head "We can't be seen to be miserly with the crisis on--"

"Who's saying we're miserly?!" A broad gesture as he swept his hands across the servants that were waiting in the wings. "Fanny, we sell violins, we're not goddamn bankers!!"

Clara reached for her fork, only to see Ms. Hardgreaves shaking her head softly. She curled her fingers instead. She tried clearing her throat but the gesture was ignored by her parents. Her mother put forward, "The Fairweathers put up one-hundred,"

"So you give one-hundred and ONE. You don't triple it. This isn't a game, Fanny, platinum pieces AREN'T TOYS!" With that, he angrily grabbed his cutlery and started attacking his meal. This caused Clara and Ms. Hardgreaves to do the same in synchronicity. He continued, "How am I supposed to pay for this? I'm going to need a massive loan!!"

"The work--" her mother started.

"WHAT WORK?!" her father was so furious he almost spat the food out of his mouth, "Who's buying violins when half the city is obliterated?! Who's coming to Gylden when there's necromancers blowing up the sky and raising the gods-damned dead?"

The argument continued with the pair of them shouting over each other. All of the Steibelt's customers had announced that either they'd reconsidered purchasing a new instrument in light of the circumstances, or they had decided not to come to Masacoll for their summer holiday. Over forty cancellations were announced for the rest of the year. This left the family with enough money to maintain their residence, staff and lifestyle for eighteen months, until Clara's mother donated more than sixty-percent of their money to the relief effort. This left her parents with little to do but argue with each other.

Clara put down her cutlery as she finished eating her bread. She, of course, had eaten it bite-for-bite in polite little mouthfuls as she listened to her family argue. "May I be excused?" she asked quietly, looking at Ms. Hardgreaves.

The governness' features were harsh as she looked at Clara. Pursing her lips, she nodded slightly. Clara dabbed the napkin against her lips and rose from the table. Her parents didn't even notice that she'd stood. "Are you seeing your friends today, Clara?" her grandmother asked.

Clara smiled, "Yes, Nonna. I was hoping to go to Madam Crackleroar's today."

Her grandmother smiled warmly, hearing that name, "Oh and how is that delightful little Ashna doing?"

Clara nodded, "Yes, she's well. She and Nelly are--"

"Clara." The icy finality of her governness' voice made Clara pause immediately, "Once you've excused yourself, you can leave. If you choose to stay and make conversation, you must sit. Nobody wants to crane their necks to speak."

Clara cleared her throat. Bowing softly, "Of course, Mum,"

Before she could leave, Ms. Hardgreaves raised her hand. "I have your coat washed in my room," she said simply, "Meet me in the entryway in a moment."

Clara's head tilted in confusion at this, ordinarily a task like fetching her coat would be beneath Ms. Hardgreaves, "Mum? But wouldn't-" she cut herself off when she saw the look in the governess' face and bowed again, "Of course, Mum," making haste out of the dining room, her stomach still begging for food. "Thank you for the meal, Henry," she addressed the cook as she left.

Margaret Steibelt shook her head, "You're so hard on the poor girl," challenging her with a stare.

Ms. Hardgreaves deflated slightly when Clara had left the room, an unusually soft expression coming over her face. "I know, of course, and I know you disapprove of my methods," she turned the the matriarch of the family. "I have raised countesses, duchesses, a baroness and a princess," she responded softly, "In all my years raising children, that girl stands out so remarkably. The last thing I want to teach her is that when the times are the hardest and dignity is all we have, then we ought grip that dignity with all the fury of Moradin." Petting the side of her lips with a napkin, "With that being said, I too shall excuse myself. Sir. Miss," nodding to the parents in turn.

Clara waited in the entryway of the Steibelt residence. With all the talk of money, Clara now felt the weight of sentimentality that was contained in the hall. The full length portraits of her father, grandfather and great ancestor. Each with their violins in hand. Paintings of their children. Vases of flowers and ornate furnishings from far lands by master craftsmen. For her entire life she had taken these things in turn. Knowing that the purpose of everything, the house, the paintings, the history and the legacy was designed as an elaborate store front to sell the family instruments. Buying a Steibelt instrument meant buying into the story of their family, of Gylden and the little luthier that stowed away on a merchant ship two hundred years ago. Antonio Steibelt, the legendary pirate fiddler.

Clara smiled as Ms. Hardgreaves descended the grand staircase. In her hand was Clara's small red coat. "Thank you for getting it for me, Ms Hardgreaves,"

As she approached, the governess' eyebrow cocked and her head tilted slightly, "Well we can't very well have the young lady Steibelt gallavanting about without her coat now, can we?"

"Of course, mum," Clara said softly, reaching out to take the coat. 

Ms. Hardgreaves impatiently gestured with her hands, "Turn around and let me dress you, child."

Clara couldn't keep the surprise from her face, but after a moment she quietly complied, turning around for the governess to drape the coat over her shoulders, "Mum?" she asked behind her.

Ms. Hardgreaves reached up to hold Clara's cheek with her thumb, squeezing it firmly and slightly tugging it, "You will always be a child to me, Clara..." a small smile starting to crack in her lips, "No matter how pretty your face gets, or how tall you grow."

There was a moment of silence between them. As if for the first time, Clara realised that when she stood next to Ms. Hardgreaves, that their relative heights were getting closer. She no longer had to creak her neck to look up at her. "It's remarkable how time flies, isn't it mum?"

The governess smiled softly, "I'm sure it was torment for you, these last ten years... you know how I feel about children?"

Clara nodded with a slight bow, "Of course mum. You hate them. When they're not being snotty, loud and smelly they're running around the house breaking things and causing a mess. They lie, they steal and they destroy any fine thing they get their filthy hands on. There's not a single redeeming quality a child has."

Ms. Hardgreaves chuffed and couldn't hide the chuckle as Clara recited her complaint word for word, as if she'd studied it alongside her mathematics and music theory. "Your impression of me is quite good, cheeky thing," clearing her throat, she said, "The last thing that I hate about children though, is that when they grow tall enough, they break your heart..." she pursed her lips suddenly, swallowing a lump in her throat.

"Mum?" Clara's brow furrowed.

"I'm leaving, Clara." As she spoke the words, even Ms. Hardgreaves was surprised how hard it was to speak those words. "As you know... For the last ten years, in exchange for a small allowance, your family has seen fit to provide me with the opportunity to help raise their most excellent daughter. But, I am afraid, that with you quickly approaching maturity, my services are no longer required..."

Clara's eyes searched the complicated expression her governess was giving. It was unlike anything she'd seen before, "Um... we shall be sorry to see you go?"

Ms. Hardgreaves flicked a thumb under her own eye to rid herself of the moisture on her cheek, "Don't lie, child. Or at least for Gods-sakes get better at it."

Clara's eye contact broke as she looked away from embarassment, "Um... I'm sorry, mum."

Ms. Hardgreaves sucked air into her lungs, "Try again, then. Your family's servant has just informed you that she's leaving and will miss you. What do you say?"

Clara looked back at the governness. When prompted, almost a thousand responses came to the forefront of her mind. From well-wishes to please-don't-go's and goodbye's. A small silence was between the two of them as Clara searched her mind for the perfect one. Stepping forward, she brought her governness into a hug, "You can't slap me for breaking decorum now, you're not paid any more."

Ms. Hardgreaves trembled and stiffened, "I would do it for pleasure."

Clara giggled, stepping away, "Of course, mum," she rested her hands in her lap, and then bunched the sides of her skirt to effect a small curtsy, "Your lessons were unforgiving, and every day in your care was suffering." Taking a small pause, she continued, "But truly, Madam Hardgreaves, the things you taught me over these years was so helpful. Nobody's as awful as you are, and it makes dealing with nobles so easy! I just thank the Gods that I'm not in one of your lessons and suddenly the most selfish noble's behaviour becomes delightful."

The governess burst into laughter, "Hah! Indeed child. It is good to hear your honesty." She cleared her throat, "In turn, I have only heard amazing things about the young Miss Steibelt and her wonderful manners. Not that I've ever seen anything to praise." After a small pause, she added, "If the only thing I taught you was how to stand up straight for a change, to show off that lovely pink hair instead of hiding, that would be enough for me."

Clara giggled, and after a moment asked, "What will you do now?"

Ms. Hardgreaves nodded softly, "There is a small finishing school in Theylanar for aspiring girls. They have need for an etiquitte instructor."

"I will pray for them every night," Clara said softly.

As she turned to leave, Ms. Hardgreaves said, "Before I leave," Clara stopped in her tracks as the governess continued, "I should like to hear your violin this evening..." she cleared her throat in the awkward pause that followed, "... one last time."

Clara paused as her heart trembled, "You're leaving tonight?"

Ms. Hardgreaves nodded somberly. "I know that your travels have been difficult lately," she said quietly. "But no matter the circumstance, or the trial, nobody can ever truly steal a woman's music." Clara paused as she heard this, feeling her fingers curl and uncurl in her palm. "This is what you have taught me, Clara." Ms. Hardgreaves said with finality. In a sharp motion, she turned on her heels and moved in the direction of the sitting room, "We shall expect your audience no later than eight."

Clara walked through the mid-morning Winter air. The sun beating down hotly on the small tropical island of Masacoll. Since her allowance was cut, she was no longer able to take carriages across town, and had found herself walking time and again. People still greeted her as they recognised her famous hair and she smiled to them in turn. In her mind though, she was still trying to make sense of the events of her life over the last six months.

She still hadn't bested the nightmares of her trial in the Sea Elf capital, Lelenaes Aiqua. The young warden, looking at all of her friends arrayed in front of her. Their bodies twisted as the dark tentacles bent and broke their bones. The grinning, snaggle-toothed snarl of Ben Goldbleed as he mocked her. She could feel the incapacitating grip of fear in her throat, the way her blood turned into hot lead. Worst of all, she felt the weight of the eyes on her. The Sea Elves, Sirdan the paladin high councillor, Veda, Moidren, her friends. They all saw in perfect clarity how cowardly she was on the inside. That underneath everything, she was just a little fifteen-year-old girl with a violin who couldn't do anything. The shame that burned in her chest as she ran from the trial, eyes clamped shut.

That moment in that trial had taken everything from her. Her self-confidence completely shattered. All she felt was replaced with pure hatred. A deep and burning hatred that she had for herself, and it projected outwards as her friends all tried valiantly to cushion the harsh blows she was throwing at herself. She fell completely silent, as her friends each in turn showed their support. "You did the right thing, Clara," Meilin's words echoed in her mind over and over. Marcus' silent support next to her said as much as any word he could say. Tiv tapping the side of his head as if everything were planned. Brittney's music getting louder, with an obvious, and absent, violin part for Clara to play resounding every night since. Ashna's quiet words next to her, "One of us isn't sparkling."

The most surprising of all was Moidren. Outside of her room on that very night when she wanted to smash her treasured violin to pieces. The sullen sea elf with dark hair, that always treated her with such contempt and spite. Suddenly he made so much sense. With his tattoos displayed, and the trials he'd been through. His harsh, mocking tone was suddenly soft and understanding. She wasn't the only one who had ever failed something. 

Clara paused for a moment as she walked past the hospital district. A breeze took her hair for a moment as she looked out over the horizon. Men had been working in the Gylden crater for months now, but they still hadn't removed all of the rubble and debris that littered the area. It was surreal being able to look over the ocean from this part of the city. So much of it was flattened now. Below her, workmen yelled and hoisted a large stone block that had come loose. The city was still bleeding from Ben's attack. Clara felt her fingernails digging into her palm. "I'm going to murder that man..." she whispered softly to herself. Nevertheless, and despite herself, she took the time to admire the horizon, to feel the warm morning air on her skin, and listen to the sounds of the waking city.

Moving onward, she nodded to Ma Baker, who by this time had thought better than to ask if Clara wanted a sweet bun that morning. The old lady couldn't hide her surprise when she saw the young girl approach. With a couple of copper pieces, Clara bought a cinnamon roll. The old baker smiling from ear to ear as she packed a smaller one along with the one Clara bought. "Nobody else will buy it anyway," she explained, "I hope one of your little friends likes it, Clara dear."

Moving down one of the alleyways of the shopping district, Clara finally approached the small, tattered curtain that covered Madam Crackleroar's humble fortune telling abode. She came in the rear of the shop, and announced her arrival, "Ashna? Madam Crackleroar?"

"Your ARRIVAL was FORE-TOLD" Madam Crackleroar intoned from the kitchen, causing Clara to giggle from the familiar greeting. "The one you seek is upstairs with her nose in books,"

"Good morning Mrs. Crackleroar," Clara said gently, as she made her way up stairs to the top of the shop, past the old fortune teller's trinkets and knick-knacks that littered the shelves and walls. The small shop was much more cozy than the Steibelt residence, but Clara often felt that the smaller structure was surrounding her like a warm, cozy hug as she navigated it. "Ashna?" She called from outside her room.

"I love you too, Clara," Ashna's voice came from within, sounding hurried and rushed as usual. 

Clara giggled, feeling her face growing hot. "I think you're out of order again, Ashna,"

"Oh... yes of course. Come in!" Ashna said hurriedly.

Shifting the room's curtain aside, Clara entered the small room. The blue-scaled dragonborn was before her. From a glance, Clara could tell that Ashna hadn't properly shedded her scales for a week. Old scales cracked around her face, with new ones underneath just waiting to surface. As usual, Ashna was reading by gaslight. A small desk and a bed, leaving little standing room in the teenage dragonborn's room. It was little wonder how Ashna felt just as cozy at home as she did in Nelly's tiny little closet.

Picking her way across the room, Clara pushed aside the window curtain to let the sunlight through, "Did you sleep last night, Ashna?" she asked sweetly.

As the beams of sunlight glinted off her scales, she squinted and blinked her inner eyelids, "Sss, that light is a little harsh..."

Clara reached for her bag, pulling out the little cinnamon roll and putting it on Ashna's desk. "I found a silver piece last night in my dresser, so I could visit Ma Baker on my way here..."

Ashna's eyes widened as she took the gift in two hands and promptly began devouring it, ripping the soft bread apart in her fingers and swallowing down the delectable treat. "Mm! I haven't had one of these in forever! Not since..."

The next words she cut off, and Clara smiled at her friend as they both shared the sombre moment. Clara turned away from Ashna after a moment to place her hand on the windowsill and look out at the street below, "Do you know why your foresight failed..? I know you were worried about it for the last little while."

Ashna for her part turned back to her desk, "It's difficult, difficult, yes," her scaled brow furrowing as she absently scratched off one of her shedding scales. "It's been bothering me, but maybe not as much as radiant magic. How do powerful beings like Gods and the like use magic without the weave? It doesn't make sense, make sense..."

Clara could hear in her friend's demeanour that the question was being avoided. For someone who took great pride in tarot and divination, not being able to foresee the death of their dearest friend must have felt deeply frightening, at least that was what Clara presumed. She could tell that Ashna had spent the time with her nose buried in books and questions to avoid the topic, but didn't know how to support her beyond the occasional visit and sweet bun.

Ashna looked up towards Clara, "What do you think the difference is, between a warlock and a cleric? Why is one arcana with schools and the other divine with gods?"

Clara turned around, thinking about the question for a moment, "Uhm... wasn't that a topic in Faustus' Tome of Demonic Summoning?" Referring to a book they'd read together in getting their magic licenses.

Ashna chuffed, her tail making a long swish to smash against the leg of her table, "That dry old text barely said anything. It was all descriptions of Weavic Interference, not real, nothing about how it /felt/ to channel abyssal energy, or another entity's energy. I want to hear it from someone who actually does it. How do you break the rules, Clara? How do you do magic without actually doing magic?"

Clara leaned back against the window, turning her head to gaze across the arcane scribblings that were sprawled across the wall. She recognised some of the wizardry that was there, but most of it was beyond her. "Well... put simply, I don't. My lady Titania came to me because I couldn't do magic... the weave doesn't listen to me, no matter how much I focus or how I move my hands."

"But then how does the magic come out?" she asked the next logical question.

Clara paused for a moment, staring down at her open palm, "It's something to do with the contract..." she said slowly, "When I sweep my hand, I don't feel the weave like you do, I feel something different. Like a resistance or a string I can tug on. When I tug, I feel like Titania is suddenly all around me, holding me, hugging me, and she speaks the words of the spell into my mind and controls my body to cast it properly."

Ashna's eyes narrowed as she looked at Clara thoughtfully, "A string like a puppet string, attached by the contract." Clara cleared her throat awkwardly, but didn't respond. "And this works despite Titania not being a God, despite you not worshipping her?"

Clara sighed and her gaze swept across to look Ashna in the face, "Rather than worship... I'd say that Titania's rather in my bad books at the moment..."

Ashna blinked in surprise, "Your bad books?" Clara nodded, but didn't specify. Ashna took a moment to consider her friend quietly. Turning back to her desk, "So how does that work with the magic? Can you still cast as you do normally?"

Clara's eyes glowed suddenly in a soft amber. The whites of her eyes disappearing to an insect-like gold as an otherworldly swirling energy whipped her pink hair around her, "You tell me, Ashna..." the low level suggestion vibrating out from her mouth and swirling around the weave to surround her friend.

Since Clara didn't put a lot of herself into the spell, Ashna was able to resist the urgent twist of her stomach to respond immediately as Clara commanded. Clicking her tongue, she said, "A simple, 'yes' would have sufficed." Ashna turned back to her book, flipping open a new page and writing fervently, "Fascinating, fascinating."

After a moment, Clara walked forward to put her hands on Ashna's desk. "So I guess you're set for the day? Another study session?" Ashna's head moved from left to right, her claws reaching out to fondle the spine of one book, then the next. Clara moved around behind her to put her arms around the dragonborn's shoulders.

"It's not my fault," Ashna whispered, accurately predicting what Clara was going to say. "You know I don't like this stuff."

Clara paused for a moment. She leaned subtly so that her fleshy cheek was scraped lightly against Ashna's scales, their eyes almost level. "You're important to me, Ashna..."

"As you remind me constantly..." Ashna responded, a tinge of frustration to her voice.

Clara turned her head to kiss her scaled cheek softly, "And I'll keep doing it, too." before letting go, a soft smile on her face.

Before Clara turned to leave, Ashna put her hand on a small piece of paper and touched Clara's hand to keep her attention. "By the way, today's reading." Ashna didn't turn to face Clara, instead keeping her eyes on the desk, "Violin, crown, sword. Third day in a row for violin," she said shortly, "Leave your hair in the bowl for tomorrow's."

Clara smiled as she tucked the tarot reading away in her coat before leaving, "I love you, Ashna."

"I've already said it," Ashna said dismissively, which caused Clara to giggle as she left.

As Clara left, Ashna looked to the doorway curtain, and opened a drawer to her right. Reaching in, she pulled a book that seemed to drip from knitted flesh. The wicked smile on the cover widening as it came into the light. "Okay... back to this... how to make a permanent servant with stable intelligence matrix WITHOUT evil divinity..." she mumbled under her breath. "How... to make... a Ben Goldbleed..."

Clara felt a shiver in her spine as she walked towards Alcazar. In the moments after Ben Goldbleed and his hordes of undead were driven back by the mighty explosion, the greatest outpouring of humanity that Gylden had ever seen took place. The sheer magnitude of the magical war that had waged between the mighty necromancer and the mysterious dwarven arch-wizard Nelly was something incomprehensible to most people. Nevertheless, the event had truly shaken every citizen of Gylden to the core. The horrendous sight of the dead shambling to the shore, the dreadful feeling watching the powerful magics push against each other, the sheer amount of death and destruction that had rained from the heavens to put an end to it. Clara always silently thanked whatever Gods would listen, that Ben Goldbleed was blamed for the explosion, and not her dear friend Tiv. Had it been the latter, she would have found her emotions difficult to work with.

After the initial disaster, which blasted away entire suburbs of the city, there was an immediate effort to scavenge the blast site and surrounding areas. The watch led by lady Esmerelda Gylden and her family, poured the coffers of the city and more into the rescue and preservation of life. The immediate issues were medical aide, a simple headcount to account for all the souls living, and supply of food and blankets to the newly homeless. People worked day and night, from all walks of life, clearing rubble, bandaging wounds and setting bones. From girls like Clara herself to strapping sailors and dock workers. They organised in shifts to clear the wreckage and take stock of the raw damage that had been done in the attack.

After two weeks, a small shanty town had been crudely erected to house the residents of the district. Thick canvas blankets tied with sailor knots. People living in whatever dignity they could find with only a few sheets of iron and wood pallets for furniture and comfort. Mourning the dead in large memorials while trying to get on with life. In order to avoid the stigma, and to live with some sense of pride, the residents of the new shanty district came to calling their place "Alcazar", the name of a distant, exotic, palatial residence in the far east. Though some saw it as a joke that a shanty was referred to as a palace, after two months, residents lived with soft smiles as they heard the name said unironically.

Children liked to play in Alcazar, one of them softly bumping into Clara's legs and grinning with a broad, crooked grin. Clara laughed back at the kid as she gently pushed him off. "Wait for me!" his friend called after, chasing him with a stick almost half his size in length. The shanty town was largely safe. Opportunists and crime notwithstanding, Clara was able to walk unimpeded towards her destination. Cutting under a corrugated sheet of iron, and stepping past an anchor supporting a mooring rope, she came to the food clearing and her face brightened. Seeing Brittney manning the icecream stall next to Tedac Lowan.

"**Icecream!**" Britt projected her voice outwards. From there, small heads popped from just about every conceivable nook and cranny of the clearing, and the small stand was immediately swarmed with tiny little humans, dragonborn and more. A cacophany of noise and excitement as the little hands clamoured for the frozen treats. Brittney smiled as her tail whipped behind her, the tiefling looking perfectly comfortable with so many adoring kids clamouring for the truck, "Alright, alright... one as a time now... one at a--" one of the kids knocked the cart, causing Britt to huff in a lungful of air and yell

## "ONE AT A TIME YOU LITTLE SHITS!!"

The whip crack of her voice almost shaking some of the surrounding houses apart. All of the surrounding noise stopped. Clara giggled from the sight of the stunned expressions of the children.

Their eyes met in that moment and Britt's tail straightened in surprise. "Claaraa!" Whipping her head around to Tedac, the old firbolg's round cheeks lifted in a smile and he nodded gently, causing Britt to yank off her apron and skip through the crowd to meet her friend.

Britt threw her arms around Clara warmly and the two shared an embrace as they squeezed in a tight hug. "It's good to see you, Brittney," Clara said softly.

Brittney stood back and petted down Clara's shoulders, looking at her from head to toe, "And what about you? Hmm? Out of the house again? That's a cute coat, where have you been hiding this one?"

Ever since the trial under the ocean, Brittney's unwavering positivity was one of the things that brought Clara through her darkest thoughts. Even through the explosion, it was Brittney's music that Clara heard above the cacophany of panic and pain, it was Brittney's music that made her sing. "I can't seem to stay in my room these days..." Clara responded simply.

Brittney's head turned slightly, the tiefling's devilish eye seeming to stare right through her, "So are you ready to give us a song? I'm sure the kids would love to hear you play 'Drunk Dwarf Derringer'."

Clara giggled softly at Britt's mannerisms, but shook her head, "I think I'll be ready soon... Ashna's fortune this morning had a violin again..."

"Huh..." Britt's face furrowed as she clicked her tongue, "We finally get one girl out of her room, and the other one hides away... what is *with* you people?" Clara smiled in response, causing Britt to start peppering questions, "So, Ashna pulled the violin card for you again? Have you managed to pick it up or is it still locked away? Is your governess still giving you trouble? What's going on with you and Moidren lately?"

Moments melted into hours as they talked. Meandering through Alcazar, the wardens seemed lost in conversations and memories. They spoke of Meilin, who was on a training mission in Lelenaes Aiqua, they spoke of Ashna and Marcus and each other. The one conversation topic they delicately avoided was their friend Tiv. 

As they rounded a corner, Clara's attention was caught by a flash of light hitting her eye. Looking down towards an alley, she smiled softly. "Ah... I have to go,"

"You're with Marcus again?" Britt asked in a soft whisper, to which Clara nodded. 

"You can come if you like..." Clara said.

Brittney shook her head slowly, "I'd rather hand out icecream to kids right now than run around beating them up."

Clara stepped forward to hug her friend, "I love you, Brittney,"

Petting her back warmly, Brittney responded, "I love you too, sweetheart."

The alley was formed between two of the shanty buildings in Alcazar. Their sidings used to be from armor plating on the hull of an army supply ship. The towering sheets of rusted metal dwarfing the little pink haired girl, and the tall, shadowy figure she was approaching. "I got your things..." Marcus said simply, unhooking his shoulder bag and putting it on the ground between them. "I'll watch out while you get changed."

Clara smiled up at him, but his unsmiling eyes stared back. Marcus had taken the events of the explosion to the chest, and he wasn't ready to smile yet. Clara took the bag quietly and removed the contents. Clothing. Black leather jherkin, form fitting breeches and a black sleeved tunic. Clara strapped her chest before she got dressed. Tying up her hair into a hive and hiding it under a black hood. When she was ready, her black apparel matched the much larger lad next to her. "Don't forget your handkerchief," Marcus said quietly, handing her a large piece of cloth that she tied across her mouth and nose.

It was all well and good for Marcus to go outside of the guards' remit. Nobody would question the adopted son of lady Gylden, former urchin and ruffian for being nosy around the docks. For Clara though, matters of identity were far more concerning. Nevertheless, Marcus covered his identity too, not wanting to bring shame to either the town guard or his adopted family. The black hooded pair snaked through the winding passages of Alcazar together. Silently.

Things had been quieter since the first couple of weeks of the disaster, but they were by no means calm. Lady Esmerelda's guard were busy with relief efforts, and couldn't attend to simple policing duties on the dockside. Moreover, while most people of Gylden were warm of heart when it came to the disaster, rats always seemed to rise to the smell of opportunity.

With Marcus leading the way, the pair made their way through Alcazar and towards the dockside. They had been monitoring shipments of food and construction materials for the last two weeks. Large portions of cargo were going missing. With no obvious explanation, the only readily available culprits belonged to the feywild. This made Marcus' instincts go wild, both as a street rat, and as a town guard. 

The black hooded pair wound up perched on a rooftop overlooking the dock workers. Eagle eyes flickering over the meandering people down below. With every minor disturbance, one of them would snap their head to see. The vantage point they used was one that Veda had told them about. Allowing almost perfect monitoring of the north dock. They could see the expressions of the workmen, even smell the aroma of their sweat as they hauled from the ship.

Minutes passed to an hour, which passed to two. The workers changed shifts and Clara shifted uncomfortably. Marcus finally broke the silence, "The snake rose tattoos aren't here today..."

Clara sighed and nodded, leaning against the facade of the roof. "So weird..." she panned across the crowd, "Who were those men, then? They had to be foreigners. I didn't recognise any of them."

"... and you've got a good memory for faces," he finished.

The only lead other than pixies for the missing supplies were a gang of workers that all bore snakes and roses on their shoulders. Matching tattoos were often a sign of brotherhood on long voyages for ship crews, not to mention undesirables. "Is it a dead end..?"

Marcus shook his head, "Wood doesn't just grow legs and walk off... somebody knows what happened to that shipment from Theylanar, and there are families that need homes."

Clara nodded softly. There was little else said between them as the sun made its way across the sky. At the last bell, the workmen cheered and hollered, their work song changing to a drinking song as the crowd of men jostled and clapped each other across the back. Clara rubbed the back of her neck, only to feel strong, rough knuckles pushing against her spine, "Mm!" she shivered from the sensation as her muscles unknotted.

"When you sit still too long you get stiff..." Marcus said simply, massaging her back.

She turned to him, and smiled underneath the handkerchief, "Well I was planning on getting some exercise... but the baddies didn't show up."

"... lucky them..." he said thoughtfully. "You probably would have blown them to pieces."

Making their way off the roof, the pair picked their way back to Alcazar, and disappeared into the winding alleyways of the shanty town. Going to where they'd stashed Clara's clothes, Marcus once again stood watch while Clara transformed herself from a hooded vigilante and back into a woman. Emerging from the alley, she offered the bag of clothes to Marcus, who took it and strapped it across his broad shoulder. Reaching up as he took the bag, Clara softly cupped his left cheek and smiled into his expression. "You're still having trouble smiling,"

His expression softened. Unable to remain stern with Clara so close to him, "The anger hasn't left me yet..."

Clara smiled softly, her hand lifting from his cheek, "It will... you saw how I was a few nights after..."

He thought back to a moment soon after the explosion, finding Clara in a clearing by herself. A tear-streaked face as her bones creaked and crackled from eldritch energy. She'd been casting eldritch blast at a tree over and over again, as if that tree were the devil itself. The bark on the outside of it crackled to black ash as the wood stubbornly stood tall. She said later that she lost count how many times she'd slammed her blast into it, casting the cantrip until her fingers burned.

"How are you dealing with it?" he asked in the present. 

Clara tucked her chin down. The question was deep, and it made her ruminate for a moment. "...maybe because I was already angry. About the stupid sea elf trial." Her eyes searched the ground between them for the answer as her head lowered. "I was angry at myself, and the world, and everything... and it didn't really help anyone. And when I saw everyone in pain..." she looked back up at him, her thought cut in the middle,  "... it still doesn't feel real... does it?" Marcus shook his head in agreement. Clara continued, "... anyway. If I want to be angry, I know who to be angry at," she looked him in the eye, "No man is responsible for this... for any of this. No man except for Ben Goldbleed." She reached out to take his hands, holding them softly in her own, "And if I want to smile, and want to feel love and warmth and happiness, then I know who to smile at," her smile crept slowly across her face. "My friends. The wardens of Masacoll."

After a moment, Marcus nodded softly, and soon found himself embracing the small girl. "Maybe I'll learn how to smile again too..."

Clara smiled into his chest and squeezed tightly, "You will..." before letting go and turning to leave she said, "I love you, Marcus."

"Love you too, Clara," he said simply. Before she left his sight, he raised his voice, "How are you going with violin?"

She stopped in her tracks and turned, "Oh... Getting closer... I wanted to try again tonight. Ashna pulled the third violin in a row for me today."

He nodded softly, "Well, good luck then. You'll get it soon."

On her way home, she walked past the Gylden Crater once more. The noise from the workmen had shifted from the sounds of hoists and coordination to the sound of drinking and cameraderie. The sun hung wide and low on the horizon, casting a dramatic spread of orange and red across the sky. The distant sound of the sea washing over her ears, and the squawking song of seagulls reaching her. As she listened to the soundscape before her, she found herself humming quietly, a melody that rose and fell with a soft, whispering voice.

Moving down the street, she made for her final destination on that day. Tiv's place. Approaching the outside of the junkyard, Clara looked up at the pile of scrap, old ship parts and sheet metal that made up the kobold's humble home. Townspeople walking past behind her, and the sound of  a horse cab clopping over the street drummed against her ears. 

Clara's ears were sensitive in this moment. If she strained, she could hear a breath, a cough, an insect's wings, her own heartbeat. She felt her cheeks getting warm, and her breath started to get caught in her throat. A small squeak escaped her throat and she wiped her face, trying to compose herself from crying. 

Clara could hear everything. But the one thing she'd never hear again was Tiv.

Taking a moment, she sucked in air in large, thick gulps and looked up at the old junkyard. The lifeless pile of leftovers held a special place in her heart. Remembering all the hideouts and games the wardens would play together. She remembered nursing Tiv's egg with Ashna. Scolding Marcus when he got himself hurt. Eating sweets with Brittney, and bringing extra for Meilin. So many little moments that existed in her heart.

The flutter of wings caught her attention as Quesoraxia alighted on her shoulder. The small pixie girl with insect wings was as light as a feather and could fit on her palm. Clara turned her head slightly as she felt her fairy friend coming to greet her. Likewise, arriving from a disc of swirling light that seemed impossibly thin, Spot arrived. His gleaming diamond scales glistening in the gloaming sunset light. The moments of purple twilight was always the time of day when the mortal realm had the most affinity with the land of witches and the wilds of the fey.

Her eyes adjusting to the fading light, the lights of the fey began to surround her, and those that were onece indistinguishable as humans shed their disguises for those who were trained to see it. A mother escorting her children soon grew smart and long rabbit ears, the harengon scolding her little ones for being tardy. The irish drunk growing rounder and stouter, the leprechaun's hiccups singing loudly with his soft chuckling. 

"There are more than normal..." Clara whispered to the pixie on her shoulder. The fey creatures of winter and wonder had slowly but surely gathered at Tiv's junkyard.

"They want to hear you play, Clara..." she said simply. There was an edge to her words, perhaps a sense of concerned urgency.

"I forgot my violin." Clara spoke with a soft finality. After a time, as she saw sprites, spriggans and mufflewumps appearing from the junkyard and around her, Clara raised her voice, "Tell your stupid queen I'm not playing!! I'm not playing, I won't play, And you can't make me!!" As she yelled she stomped her foot petulantly and pursed her lips.

Reacting to her outburst, pixies were pushed away from her, the harengon's ears startled and stared in her direction, the leprechaun almost rolled over and the mufflewump's big fluffy ears folded in as it covered it's eyes. It was only momentary, however, as the fey slowly returned to their naturally curious and playful demeanour.

Quesoraxia lifted her tiny hand, and Clara felt her tiny fingers scratching behind her ear affectionately. "I know it still hurts Clara..." to which Clara nodded as she watched the fey skipping about their business. "You don't have to do anything you don't want to."

There was the sound of a combined, unearthly growl. Clara recognised the warning and hissing of a Blinkdog, and felt Spot hissing from her ankles. A deep, abyssal voice intoned, "Ahh, but is that true, little pixie?" Yarlin's thrumming baritone was next to her. The skin on her cheek felt warm from the black hot glow of his leathery, red flesh. "After all, our beautiful, young musician here is under a contract."

Quesoraxia flew away from Clara's shoulder, flitting backwards and forth aggressively, holding a sparkling little spear in her tiny arms. "Devil!" Along with Quesoraxia, the rest of the fey were starting to snark, scratch and click aggressively in the direction of the devil.

Yarlin, ever the flirt, push his hands up in surrender and turned to show the creatures of the feywild that he was there in peace. "Please, please! Put your little bits and bobs away, faeries," a grin spread across his face, "I was invited."

"By who!" Quesoraxia squeaked. 

Yarlin unfurled a long, clawed finger and gestured to Clara's left. A sparking, spiralling song of harmony filled the air. The scents of fresh flowers filled the atmosphere around her, as her bright, cherry-pink hair tumbled down to her muddy, bare feet. Clad in a dress made from winter leaves, the pink-haired eladrin woman with eyes that sparkled like gemstones appeared next to her. "By me, my pixie." Titania, queen of the fae, had appeared in the flesh. 

Titania looked as regal as she ever did, even with her unconventional garments. She was impossibly beautiful, and her presence seemed to make the very air vibrate in celebration. "Have you prepared yourself, my darling captain? Clara?"

Clara nodded quietly, and Yarlin scoffed, "Belive me, this will be a pleasure..."

Titania sighed slowly, "Warlock contracts are enforced at a much higher court than either of us, devil. Be careful what you wish for..."

It wasn't ordinary for such godly beings to appear in the mortal realm, but as Clara looked around, she realised that there was very little of the mortal realm left in her surroundings. Long dais' holding important looking fey were around her. Important and decorated members of the seelie court were staring at her with terrible, otherworldly gazes. Swirling purple mists and miasma whirled about the courtyard. The only beings out of place were herself, from the mortal realm and Yarlin, from the Nine Hells of Baator.

Across from where Clara stood alongside Yarlin and Titania, were three large, wooden benches. Behind these benches were three creatures, on the left a small, bespectacled fey creature with a long nose, that Clara recognised as some form of bookish goblin. On the right was a bored looking, pale-skinned devil that she knew as a Wretch. In the middle was a creature with no distinct form, a swirling cloud of ancient energy. The ancient symbol of Ao, overgod of the cosmos, decorated the benches.

"You stand before a tribunal of three," the bookish goblin spoke. "One fey, one abyssal, and one neutral adjudicator. Do you all accept the authority of this court? Any objections?"

Clara looked up at the judges in quiet silence, and looked to Titania and Yarlin in turn. They remained quiet. Yarlin's respectful silence seemed strange to her, but she guessed this was part of his strategy.

"Alright," the goblin adjusted his spectacles, and lifted a large sheet of paper, that almost seemed bigger than his head. The crinkling papers shuffled loudly. "We are here to settle the matter of the contract between Queen Titania of the Fey and her musician, the mortal violinist Clara Steibelt. Also here is a contesting patron, the devil pirate Yarlin of Dis, to speak as barrister for the signee. Is this who you all are?" Yarlin and Titania nodded silently, and Clara remained quiet, feeling her fingers curl into a small ball.

"As this is a fey contract..." the goblin judge continued, "by tradition, I, the fey judge will be asking the questions. Now my understanding is that Clara has refused to play her violin in any significant way for more than six months?"

"That is correct," Yarlin responded calmly.

"And in exchange for her playing the violin she was supposed to have been awarded fey powers, is that correct?" His voice came out, biting the wind.

"That is correct." Titania responded.

The small goblin's brow furrowed and knitted. "And she was awarded her powers?"

"Of course," Titania said simply.

"Well what in the realms is the problem? How is there possibly a case? Are we here to transfer the contract? Are we just here to execute the punishment to recompense the contract?" The goblin swept his hand across the court. "Speak! The floor is open."

Yarlin stepped forward, "The contract is voided, adjuntar," his infernal baritone raising. "My darl-- my ward, Clara, found the powers insufficient to protect her friend, Tiv, so she was not awarded enough power by the faerie queen. As written, the contract was to award 'the power to save your friends'. But evidently, adjuntar, one of those said friends is now dead and with the Raven queen. We request the immediate nullification of the contract of Queen Titania."

"What?!" The small goblin's spectacles almost fell from his nose as he jumped. "Erm... my queen... do you have a response?"

Titania shook her head from side to side, silently. "It is as the devil said, mighty adjuntar," despite her voice being soft, the weight it carried was heavy in the air. "On this day, two months since, my dear sweet musician's friend met his demise at his own hands while protecting the city of Gylden. Because of this, the signee has not been able to emotionally bring herself to play music."

"... and the four months previous?" The goblin scoured the sheet in front of him, as an overlarge quill scribbled notes next to him.

Titania responded, "She was beset by a terrible depression. I allowed her the maximum possible extension, as stipulated in the contract, to ease her emotional distress." She took a small pause, clearing her throat, "Failing a sea elf trial in Lelenaes Aiqua was the cause. Again, she found the awarded powers insufficient to protect her friends."

The Wretched devil judge leaned forward, "Surely, Queen Titania, you're not suggesting to a court that represents powers of the cosmos that there was a circumstance where the power of the Feywild and the Seelie court were insufficient in tackling mortal affairs??"

Titania turned, looking at Clara, and feeling a small smile stretch across her face. "If I may, adjuntar," she said slowly, "It is a rare talent I deal with, and a rare circumstance in which I find myself." Stepping forward, the queen gracefully took the floor of the court. "The whims and mores of fate seduced me towards making a pact with this young violinist, the mortal Clara Steibelt. The tenacity of her soul and the music of her heart enchanted me, as it enchanted my counterpart, Yarlin of Dis. Ordinarily, I would take this opportunity to argue the merits of my magic, decry the weak flesh of mortals, to talk until I was blue in the face about duty, power, caveats and legal matters." Taking a pause, she looked up to address the panel of judges, with her hand swept backwards towards Clara. "But ultimately, doing so here would remove from the universe this girl's music. This was the very thing my contract was designed to protect. So if I must admit to the powers of the universe, that it was my powers that failed at a critical moment instead of the mortal's own weakness, then that is what I shall do." A smile curled at the side of her lips, "Because it is a faerie's whim to do so."

The judges shared looks between them for a moment, before the goblin spoke, "Er... surely... my queen... there is a circumstance where Clara herself failed to apply her magic properly..?"

Yarlin spoke, "The only possible solution, adjuntar, was for Clara to completely dominate the body of her friend so that his suicide was impossible. But this would have negated his free will, and thus his soul wouldn't have been adequately saved." He looked over to queen Titania, "This fact was agreed by the fae queen in private council."

"So there was a solution," the wretched devil sat forward. Yarlin and Titania assented. The devil spoke again, "And you are saying this solution was null, Queen Titania?" Titania assented. To this, the devil again sat back, and looked over to the other judges.

The rumination of the judges was tense. The faeries that had gathered began to quietly chitter and scratch. Titania approached Clara again and gently rested her hand on her shoulder. A look between herself and Yarlin was shared, silent, complex emotions swirling between them. After half an hour passed, the goblin judge cleared his throat to silence the court.

"Erm... while it is unusual," his voice boomed with an unnatural, innate power that shook the bones of all present, "it is not entirely unprecedented for both patron and signee to desire the termination of a warlock contract," as he fell silent, his eyes started to glow with an ethereal energy. The devil spoke next, with the same voice, "These contracts are enforced by a power higher than all beings, and judged by this court, which all beings in the cosmos recognise."

Both the devil and the goblin spoke in unison. "In light of the circumstances that both parties recognise. This court has decided it was the failure of the patron, Titania, to provide the power to protect the mortal life of the signee's beloved companion. This court has made the decision that the contract is therefore not enforcible, and hence voided. All clauses are now null. All bindings between Titania, queen of the Fae and Clara Steibelt are broken, and neither is bound by any clause of the contract heresigned. Is this judgement understood?" The silence in the cosmic court was thick enough to cut. "So be it."

Clara gasped as she felt the wind leave her lungs. A swirling pink and green cloud of energy being tugged from her soul as all her latent magical energy left her. The warlock contract was broken. Completely gone. Titania's magic no longer flowed in her veins, and her senses returned after a moment. 

Blinking, Clara found herself once again staring at Tiv's junkyard. The sun had long set, and the black of evening was interrupted by small gaslit lanterns that lined the streen. The spires of sheet metal once again stretched into the sky. A voice to her side, "Miss? Miss?" Looking up, she saw the face of an enforcer she recognised.

"Oh, hello Alec," she said sweetly.

The enforcer tipped his head and shuffled awkwardly, "You've been staring at the yard now for the last couple hours, I reckon... are you okay?"

Clara smiled, "Never better!" and sighed softly. "... someone just did me a big favour. Maybe one I'll never be able to repay..."

Alec rubbed his helmet with a large, gauntleted hand, "Uhh... favour?"

Clara nodded, and moved towards him, taking his elbow, "Won't you escort me home?"

The young guard flinched as she took his elbow and stammered, "O-Of course Cl-Cl... Miss Steibelt."

As they turned to leave, a tall, hooded figure stepped before them. Looking up to her, Clara immediately recognised the shadowed figure. Looking to Alec, she saw that his head was thrown back, and he was fast asleep in an enchanted slumber. "Titania..." she whispered.

The faceless, shadowed figure stepped forward. "Excuse me for interrupting again, dear Clara," 

Clara tucked her chin slightly, "I can't believe... you broke it for me..."

"I can't believe you played chicken with the cosmos," Titania's voice reverberated from the shadowed hood. Reaching into the folds of its cloak, the figure spoke, "A final gift from me," she said softly. "You're a rare mortal, Clara. The way your soul shines is unique in so many ways." From the folds of its cloak, Clara was presented with an old, intricately engraved, though elegantly plain cherrywood violin and bow.

Clara reached out and took it, her hands trembling, "Truly... I thought I was going to die... is this... is..." Clara turned the fiddle over in her hand, inspecting the workmanship and quality. Her voice lost from surprise, her hands shaking as she realised the maker. The signature unmistakable, Antonio Steibelt.

Titania spoke, "... a violin. Crafted at my request by the pirate fiddler, Antonio Steibelt," she said simply, "A personal friend of mine, and your great grandfather. Using techniques only he knew, and wood supplied by the oldest woods of the feywild. Grown by spriggans and blessed by owlbears. From a wood that sings the songs of morning and whispers the hymns of night. Strung by silk of feyspider and played exclusively in my personal court."

Clara's hands started trembling. The thing she was holding was beyond precious. "This violin... we... we don't have an original Steibelt... they were all thought lost..." Looking up, a silent question hung in her mind. Why?

"Consider it a gift of goodwill, consider it an apology, consider it a parting gift or a way to honour the spirit of your dear companion. The fates are not finished toying with you, Clara, and seeing you succeed is of personal interest to me. Whether you like it or not, you still cannot channel magic yourself, and will need a patron for your upcoming trials. So, if it is your will, call to us again when you seek to draw on our power and we will give you gifts untold as we dance gaily to your music. Or, sign your soul to Yarlin and take him as your lover, wrap him around your finger and suck his magic dry. As a font of power, there are many patrons who will be keen to court you. In any case, for tonight, play for your father, and rediscover your music." Titania's voice giggled sweetly as the shadowy figure sucked into itself and vanished. A small whisper in the air, "As I said when we first met, Clara. A woman ought to have choices, wouldn't you say?"

Clara felt herself smile softly, as she clutched the old violin to her chest. "Thank you... pink haired bitch... Titania."
